Blue Lock had a lot of potential as an exciting sports anime centered around football, but it ultimately falls flat due to its disappointing, almost PNG-like animation quality. While the premise of a high-stakes competition to find Japan's best striker is intriguing, the execution leaves much to be desired. The animation quality, crucial for a sports anime, often feels rushed and inconsistent, resembling poorly rendered PNG images rather than the fluid, dynamic visuals one would expect from a show about a fast-paced sport. Many action sequences lack the fluidity and detail necessary to convey the excitement of the matches, making them come off as choppy and disjointed. Key moments that should be thrilling are undercut by still frames which detracts from the overall impact of the story. At this rate I don't even see a reason to even watch the anime rather go read the manga instead since the anime is just like those moving manga panel \"edits\" you see in TikTok.\nImnotindangerskyleriamthedanger\nOct 20, 2024\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

It's like a slide show. I see people say that they are saving budget, but an anime shouldn't need to save their budget for one match, it should be constant throughout the anime. It's almost unwatchable with this animation. Specification: There's never constant animation, only one thing is moving at once in a clip, 3d animation looks horrible, running looks horrible, hair movement and clothing movement moves all together instead actually being animated, and there is too much close ups rather than soccer. The anime is currently carried by sound effects and plot, other wise the animation almost makes it unwatchable.\nztrenzin\nOct 11, 2024\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

However, I wanted to share my honest thoughts about Isagi's character development, especially in the U-20 Japan vs. Blue Lock match.\nAs the main character, Isagi lacks many essential striker skills like dribbling, speed, 1v1 ability, and physical strength. Throughout the match, other players like Rin, Shidou, and Nagi had a much bigger impact, making it feel like Isagi was not the real protagonist. His final goal felt more like luck than true skill, yet he was the only one getting media attention, which seemed unfair compared to other players who performed better.\nI believe a protagonist should have a stronger role and more defining moments that showcase his actual abilities, rather than just relying on positioning and strategy. If Blue Lock is about creating the best striker, Isagi should develop skills that prove he is truly the best-not just someone who capitalizes on others' plays.\nI hope in future seasons or manga chapters, Isagi gets more well-rounded growth, making him a more deserving protagonist. Thank you for creating such an exciting series, and I look forward to seeing how Blue Lock evolves!\nBest regards,\nHabibul.\nhabibulgoni\nMar 5, 2025\nPermalink\n4\n/\n10\nThis anime deserved better\nAlthough this show was corny from the start, Season 1 was decent enough to keep me watching for the interesting twists. It felt like watching Alice in Borderland if football were the game involved. The characters were interesting, and I felt bad for Kunigami and the guy eliminated by Isagi in the very first episode.\nBut Season 2 is such a disappointment. The animation is so bad that I couldn't even focus on the story. It's not like the previous season was flawless; there were some bad CGI moments too. But it wasn't as pathetic as this atrocity. At this point, Blue Lock the anime is just a meme. If the creators are only painting manga panels (with slideshow-like movements), I'd rather just read the manga.\nIf you think that I'm being too harsh on this show, let me tell you I just finished Haikyu yesterday and today had to suffer the weekly episode of this mediocrity.\nanshumankrsingh\nNov 4, 2024\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

The first season was really good and had some fluid moments and was a general hype sports anime. The second season looked horrendous until the last episode but by that point does one well done episode negate the near PowerPoint slides that we get for most of the second season. I struggle to call it animation because it looks like slides on a screen like literal moving still images. I hate the fact that this is a super popular anime and yet it gets treated like this. Do yourself a favor and read the manga or just watch the last episode of this second season. Other than that I'll still give it a 5 because the first season was good.\nbrianhugh-25867\nJan 2, 2025\nPermalink\n5\n/\n10\nNo Goal\nThis is a sports anime that came with a lot of praise and it did deserve it to some level specifically the stellar animation. (Dang does this look pretty). Now I know that sports anime are pretty hard to pull off and are kinda niche especially if you don't know about or are fan of the sport.\nI know futbol. Im a fan. But when I even thought about an anime dedicated to the sport I was very doubtful. I mean it's an hour and bout a half of people going up and down the field and maybe a goal is scored.. not a lot of action. The solution to this lull: pretty much disregard the game and make it all about the goals. (lol) It's like making a baseball movie all about the batting. But the disregard for the sport is not really my main issue.\nEven if I didn't like the sport another key to making a good sport anime appealing even to those who don't like the sport is having engaging characters and/or storyline. I loathed most if not all the characters in this. Even the protagonist. They were too blow-up and extra. I guess another attempt to make this exciting but it just didn't work for me.\nAnimation-wise it succeeded in making kicking a soccer ball as intense as Death Note made writing into a notebook but the characters inner-monologues totally deflate those epic moments. The great mastermind dude who gathers all these great soccer players together seems like a collection of rip-offs and is the worst culprit in this trying to use animation to make the relatively mundane seem exciting. The camera swirls and black swirls swoosh in the back but it's just boring.\nWhen you ignore all the infuriating character and lackluster plot. The action is quite dope and probably would recommend only for bigger soccer fans. I dee kay\nLike most soccer matches I got bored and didn't even bother watching the end 5.49/10.\ndiegyfunteas\nAug 31, 2024\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

The anime industry does a lot of tricks to improve perception despite this and they are quite good.\nHowever, this show, specially season 2, seems to be in the lowest frames drawn in the industry. You spend all the time watching a 5 second scene where the character is frozen, giving a speech on what's happening, has happened or it's about to happen. It's tell, not show....\nThey try to hide this by having the scene move, or having background effects, like particles floating, lighting....but scenes are bassically like South Park characters.\nThe story is great and very impactful, it's pretty great, but I personally don't have the feeling of watching an anime, is more like an audio book colored manga.\nThis is supposed to be one of the flagships of the season, but the production value of the animation is just sad.\nluisq05\nDec 17, 2024\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

Based on the manga written by Muneyuki Kaneshiro and illustrated by Yusuke Nomura, the anime dives deep into the world of soccer with a unique twist that challenges the norms of teamwork and individualism.\nPlot Summary\nThe story begins with Japan's national soccer team failing to make an impact on the global stage. In response, the Japan Football Union initiates a radical new training program called \"Blue Lock.\" This program is designed to create the world's greatest striker, one who can lead Japan to World Cup glory.\nThe protagonist, Yoichi Isagi, is a high school soccer player who dreams of becoming the best striker in the world. He joins Blue Lock, where he and 299 other young and talented strikers are pitted against each other in a brutal competition. The players must outshine one another to earn the coveted title of Japan's top striker, all while dealing with their own personal demons and the high stakes of the program.\nCharacters and Performances\nYoichi Isagi is a compelling protagonist whose journey from a team-oriented player to a ruthless and strategic striker is both gripping and inspiring. His internal struggles and determination to succeed make him a relatable and likable character.\nEgo Jinpachi, the mastermind behind Blue Lock, is a fascinating character. His unorthodox methods and philosophical approach to soccer add depth to the narrative. He challenges the players' mindsets, pushing them to their limits and beyond.\nThe supporting cast, including rivals like Rensuke Kunigami, Meguru Bachira, and Hyoma Chigiri, bring their own unique styles and personalities to the competition. Their interactions and evolving relationships with Isagi add layers to the story, making each match unpredictable and thrilling.\nDirection and Animation\nTetsuaki Watanabe's direction keeps the energy high and the tension palpable throughout the series. The animation, handled by Studio 8bit, is top-notch, with dynamic action sequences and expressive character designs that capture the intensity and emotion of each match.\nThe soccer matches are choreographed with precision, showcasing a blend of realistic movements and exaggerated, almost supernatural techniques. This balance creates an engaging and visually appealing experience for viewers, whether they are soccer fans or not.\nThemes and Execution\nBlue Lock explores themes of ambition, self-discovery, and the nature of competition. It challenges the traditional notion of soccer as a purely team-oriented sport by emphasizing individual skill and ego. This fresh perspective sets it apart from other sports anime and adds a psychological layer to the story.\nThe series also delves into the characters' backstories, revealing their motivations and insecurities. This character-driven approach ensures that the audience becomes emotionally invested in their journeys, rooting for their success and understanding their failures.\nMusic and Sound\nThe soundtrack of Blue Lock is adrenaline-pumping, perfectly complementing the high-stakes action on screen. The opening and ending themes are catchy and energizing, setting the tone for the series. The sound effects during matches, from the thud of the ball to the players' intense breathing, add to the immersive experience.\nConclusion\nBlue Lock is a must-watch for fans of sports anime and psychological thrillers alike. Its unique take on soccer, combined with compelling characters and high-quality animation, makes it a standout series. The intense competition and the exploration of individualism versus teamwork offer a fresh and exciting narrative that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.\nFor anyone looking for an anime that combines the thrill of sports with deep psychological elements, Blue Lock delivers an unforgettable experience. It challenges the conventions of the genre and leaves a lasting impact with its bold storytelling and dynamic execution.\nabphadore\nJun 23, 2024\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nInsanely Entertaining\nWhile it does wither out a bit towards the end, Blue Lock has managed to entertain me for many, many weeks. Let me clear something up first off. DON'T WATCH THIS ANIME IF YOU WANT TO WATCH A GOOD SPORTS ANIME OR A GOOD ANIME ABOUT FOOTBALL. Ao Ashi is a brilliant one in that regard. I don't think this anime is even aiming to be a good sport anime. All it's trying to do is entertain the crap out of it's audience. And I think it has easily succeeded in doing that. That's why I can't even compare Blue Lock and Ao Ashi. Because both of them are aiming for very different things. And I think both of them are a success. From what I've read, the author was actually making a battle manga first, and then he changed his mind to make it about football. That alone tells you what I mean.\nNow lets get back to Blue Lock. What makes this anime so fun? Well, other than the savage animation, character design and the exciting soundtrack, I think it's seeing how all these monstrous characters compete against each other, and seeing which one of them eventually comes out on top. The different innovative games of competition as well as the high stakes, reminds me a bit of animes like Tomodachi Game. And I actually couldn't predict a lot of directions that the story went on to take, which made it all the more exciting. While I agree that this anime has no specific structure and it's just one huge moment after the other, with hardly anytime to breathe or learn about the characters in the middle, I can't exactly complain about that because I got goosebumps in almost every one of those moments.\nAnother thing I really liked about this anime was how it sets up many little points across the story, which will going to come into play later. That just made the cliff-hangers after every episode even more exciting and you just never know when they are going to resolve that plot-point. Because of the patience of the anime, and the long build-up, when those moments finally happen, they are just perfect. Golden Kamuy was another anime that did this perfectly. And Blue Lock wouldn't have been this much of a success without it's characters because I liked almost all of them, and they all get a moment to shine. Especially Isagi who seemed like a generic protagonist initially, but I loved the direction they took with him.\nBut this show always puts me off whenever it starts explaining the logic behind it's football and it's characters (like the scenes with Ego starting to explain how realistic \"that\" moment of the match was and what was the logic behind it. Clearly, this anime is illogical, so those moments just don't work for me and makes me wonder if the anime isn't self aware.\ntalking_about_movies\nMar 31, 2023\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nBlue Lock nice anime with problems\nSpoiler\nIcyMiko\nFeb 15, 2025\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nRated 7.5 but feel sometimes they have overdone it.\nStarted watching the anime beacuse of the game \"Football\", a great start to the series. Story is crunchy and well written but what bothers me is the part where they overdo before a crucial pass or goal. I understand it's needed for character's flashback and build-up but not necessarily needed everytime. The self motivation stories, flashbacks, dialogues, common none of the professionals do that before scoring a goal. It breaks the concentration of the viewers.\nEpisode 18 and still the same thing happening. Anyways will continue to watch this series till it really starts bothering me with the repeated pattern of flashbacks before every crucial moment.\nakpurendra\nFeb 12, 2023\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nIt could have been much better\nSpoiler\nakskydev\nMay 23, 2023\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

I only finish it by myself. I learned a lot from this anime. It's not only about soccer. It can also be applied in life and how to play by the system of our lives. You get to watch the development of the characters. We can see from the movie that learning is continuous, and it don't stop. Literally.\nThe main character started from the very bottom and he worked his ass off to reach the top. We can learn from his determination. Our circumstances do not hold us from reaching what we want. So, I will wait for the Season 2 of this anime to see how this ends because I want to know if the main character became the best striker that he wants to be.\nmisskikay\nSep 5, 2024\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nCool Anime, but who is the main character?\nJapanese football just can't compete at international level, but what exactly is the Japanese team missing?\nThe answer is clear - a star striker.\nFor this reason, it is decided to hold a training camp.\n300 promising striker talents are invited, but only one player can successfully complete this training camp. The remaining 299 players have to leave Bluelock and are also denied the chance to ever have a great career in football.\nAlthough I have little interest in football, I really liked \"Bluelock\".\nI've read a few times that many people don't like the drawing style, or even that little effort was put into it, but I don't see it that way - I like the drawing style, even if it's often kept rather simple.\nThe same goes for most of the animation. Unfortunately, the decision was made to animate scenes with CGI and not very well either. These CGI scenes are kept very short, but once you notice them, you can't ignore them anymore.\nHowever, even more effort was put into the character design - each player has their own individual look, which all also look very appealing. To combine all this with the characterization, many characters also have different character traits and some even have a sophisticated backstory. What confuses me though is that so many side characters get a backstory while the main character of the anime doesn't get it. We know very little about the main character so far, which is why he just doesn't seem interesting and rather unsuitable as a main character.\nWhat I like best about \"Bluelock\" is that it takes a completely new approach to sports anime. So far, many sports anime have relied on their team aspect - which of course only makes sense, but \"Bluelock\" is different. The players still have to play a lot together here, but there is also the pressure that in the end only one of them will survive and make the national team. This provides a number of new possibilities in character development and story development.\nI'm eagerly awaiting season 2 in the hope that the CGI scenes will be dropped and we'll finally get a backstory to the main character.\nLukasmj\nJul 23, 2023\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nNew installment\nSometimes the only thing keeping us away from our goals is our ego not fully maturing to take what we want from the world, one successful strike could change the whole outcome of this journey, the friends are just E stepping stones to the which one desires, everyone want too get their hands on the one in a life time contract that will change their lives for good and this story just got way too intriguing to just sit around waiting, honestly i also want too see how all this plays out in the end, that's something to keep an eye out for, anime just keeps getting better and better by the years and this one is on another level.\nH0kv5\nApr 10, 2023\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nBlue Lock. Very Good.\nBlue Lock. Very good.\nThe story takes the reality of extreme comfort that Japanese youth live, the same that leads them to apathy and disenchantment with life, and shows it in the teenager Yoichi Isagi and his desire to forge a career as a soccer player.\nIt is true that there are obvious nods towards Captain Tsubasa, even some characters are practically a quasi-copy, but they last very little at the beginning of the story. Starting because the protagonist is not an Oliver Atom (Tsubasa Ozora), rather almost the opposite, but the Blue Lock Complex challenges his talents.\nThe series is a good critique and analysis of the apathy that Japanese society lives today showing that playing as a team due to social pressure is not always the way and that what makes a country, a team, great are also the individualities that could contribute in an exceptional way.\njorgelrodriguezu\nNov 17, 2024\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nSuch a fun and unique concept with its own strength and weakness\nIt was good overall, it was fun. I believe many have said Blue Lock portrayed football in unrealistic ways and I agreed with it. However, I do find it fascinating in its own ways. I really like the premise, it's unique and fresh. I love how each character has their own times to evolve and show off their abilities, so the story didn't solely focus on the main character. The games gave me chills most of the times. Also, even though this project was made to create the best strikers, I like the way the creator kept his characters this way, they had their own unique strength & weakness and they were not forced to simply follow the order or to simply do as they were told. They did what they believe it's right and I like it.\nWhenever the students played, they usually showed their complicated thinking process, through a long monologue, especially Isagi. At first, I was so annoyed, to be honest. It was unnecessary, you wouldn't have this much times to overthink in real football games. But as time went by, I started to understand this might be real football players' state of minds anytime they're on the pitch. They have to face so many possibilities and options and they have to make the best possible decision in span of seconds and it is not easy. I think Blue Lock portrayed this quiet well, it made me wanted to understand the players more.\nAnytime I found the team members fought with each other, I thought it was maddening and a bit frustrating to watch. They wasted their times on fighting and debating over a lot of things while they're in looking for goals. But then I realized it was so difficult to integrate different visions and in the end, a compromise was needed. Blue Lock described it well too.\nI love the graphic, it was neat. The sound effects, the OVA, it suited the whole story.\nHowever, just like the other series, I do think it has some problems that cause confusion to me personally.\n1. I don't really understand Ego Jinpachi & the red-haired lady roles here. I get they're the ones who initiated the project but they weren't really involved in the students' development, imo. I know it was a very different method, but I think their involvement is also needed. They showed up several times through the screen and explained the rules, but then what? They didn't monitor the students' training techniques, they didn't really give them advice, they didn't really tell them what should they improve, all they did was obligating them to compete and let them figure their own problems by themselves.\n2. Contrary to majority of viewers, I found the last episodes of season 1 a bit underwhelming, compared to the first 12 episodes. The students were getting more inhuman and it was almost feeling like they have some kind of superpower, I don't like this.\n3. I found it hard to sympathize with Isagi's character. I don't know perhaps his character development is yet to be shown, or the creator didn't give enough backstory to allow the viewers to understand him more. I feel more attached to Bachira and Nagi. They're the most interesting characters to me.\nmaisie33\nApr 11, 2023\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\n\"Blue Lock: A Perfect 10/10 - A Game-Changer in Sports Anime!\"\nBlue Lock isn't just another sports anime; it's a revolution in the genre. Combining intense competition, psychological drama, and stunning animation, it redefines what it means to tell a story about sports. Here's why it's the ultimate sports anime:\n1. Unique Premise\nUnlike traditional sports anime that emphasize teamwork and camaraderie, Blue Lock flips the script. It focuses on the concept of egoism, where players are pitted against each other to create the ultimate striker. This fresh approach challenges conventional ideas about sportsmanship and forces viewers to rethink the balance between individual ambition and teamwork.\n2. Character-Driven Drama\nEvery character in Blue Lock is well-developed and brings a unique perspective to the competition. From Isagi's growth as a strategist to Bachira's unpredictable flair, each player has their own story and motivations. Their rivalries, alliances, and conflicts create an emotional depth that keeps you invested in their journey.\n3. High-Stakes Intensity\nThe stakes in Blue Lock are higher than any traditional tournament arc. The idea of elimination isn't just about losing a game-it's about losing your dream. The psychological tension and cutthroat environment make every match feel like a life-or-death battle, which keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n4. Stunning Animation and Visuals\nThe animation in Blue Lock is nothing short of breathtaking. Dynamic camera angles, intense close-ups, and vibrant visuals during key moments amplify the emotional and physical intensity of the matches. The action sequences are fluid, making every goal, feint, and clash unforgettable.\n5. Themes That Resonate\nAt its core, Blue Lock isn't just about soccer; it's about self-discovery, ambition, and the relentless pursuit of greatness. It speaks to anyone who's ever chased a dream, struggled with self-doubt, or been forced to make tough choices to achieve their goals.\n6. Breaking Sports Anime Norms\nWhere most sports anime focus on underdog teams rising together, Blue Lock is unapologetically about individual greatness. This bold narrative choice sets it apart and makes it a must-watch for fans craving something new and daring in the genre.\nFinal Verdict\nBlue Lock isn't just a sports anime-it's a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and innovation. With its gripping narrative, unforgettable characters, and jaw-dropping visuals, it transcends the genre and sets a new benchmark. Whether you're a fan of soccer, anime, or simply compelling storytelling, Blue Lock is an experience that cannot be missed.\noswaldrobinson\nDec 31, 2024\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

After the second episode it hit me that this could be one of the most elite sports anime of a generation. The animation and visuals are all there and I have a feeling that the best is yet to come. The ideals are strong as hell and the characters definitely each have a unique flavor of power among them. The best part about it is there is almost no cringey humor forcefully interjected, and it goes a step further in seriousness and sometimes feels like AOT levels of gravity. The stakes are high, and I have a feeling that it's going to get DARK. I'm here for it.\nvazirir-64413\nOct 18, 2022\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nThe antithesis of the power of friendship and teamwork; Egoism is the way\nDespite defying the core concepts of friendship, teamwork and selflessness shown in the majority of sports animanga, Blue lock focus on the importance of cultivating ego as the main engine in the development of the potential of an athlete is impressive.\nBoasting a wide array of unique and unforgettable characters, impressive visuals despite some clunky cgi models, a thrilling atmosphere and a well crafted storyline, where the stakes get higher with every match,this series is going to keep you at the edge of your seat, craving for more.\nUndeniably the best soccer animanga of these last years.\ntoledo_cmoises\nJul 2, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nBest Sports Anime I've Seen!\nHonestly I never comment or evaluate a show but watching Blue Lock has pushed me to it. It's one of the best sports anime out there!\nBeing a fan of football and growing up watching the endless fields of Captain Tsubasa... Blue Lock is another level and just shows how good football can be in a anime! The characters are messed up egotistical selfish maniacs with the only goal is to score, only to show they're the best striker in Japan!\nThe story is hell of entertaining with players with crazy technique and a really cool concept!\nI may be hyperbolic, but this is just to show how much I love it!\ngeoffroyodp\nMar 11, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nIDC if you don't like soccer\nThis is amazing and not just because I'm a fan of soccer. My friend put me onto this show and he hates soccer, even going so far as to call them \"foot fairies\". Blue lock adds a refreshing spin onto a relatively bland anime sports genre. Nobody is perfect and we all have our strengths and weaknesses, this show truly grasps that concept and runs with it. The animation is a little rough sometimes but makes up for it with it's badass moments. This show is the definition of epic scenes full of triumph and character building. Each character has a moment of self-reflection and I can appreciate the course Isagi's character goes on. This show has parts which real soccer fans can appreciate while also being appealing for those who may not enjoy soccer. Every character is different an in a uniquely great way.\nNow please do me a favor and watch the show, you wont regret it...\nBig_Chez\nFeb 9, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nA great sports anime .. just awesome\nIt was a great sports anime, and I got very attached to it.. the characters.. the story.. the dialogues.. the enthusiasm.. the intelligence and plot in the matches and awesome flashbacks for each character.. the anime, although it was spherical, but it did not present me with an ordinary ball.. it presented it to me in a way that made me get along and relate With the characters, although I don't like football, I got attached to the anime and the events a lot..

It can be quite exhilarating to watch sometimes, in the big moments, but the edgy dialogue and humour wasn't all that great. The characters are quite weak overall, while the story was up and down. One thing I found funny was that the 2022 World Cup happened during the airing of this anime, because I felt it unintentionally promoted this show a bit more. As for my enjoyment throughout the show, I thought it had quite an unimpressive first half, and then the story improved towards the end of the series. It's unfortunate that the animation degraded as the second half went along, or else I would have had a more favorable impression of this show overall.\nmartin_merelesc\nMar 26, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nNever though a sports show could be this good\nSo, I recently made a review on Haikyu. I said you can't expect much from a sports anime. I officially apologize. I was wrong because I have watched Blue Lock. People who watched the show must be thinking why I gave it a 9 due to the second season. Yeah, the animation was... questionable but I couldn't even look away from the screen. Blue Lock season 1 had great animation, character development, and great moments overall. Then we head to Blue Lock season 2. It was criticized for its PowerPoint like animation. And yeah, I definitely see it. It is far off from what season one's animation was, but it gets better through the season. But no matter how you put it. Every moment of this show keeps you on your toes. The characters are likeable and different. Although it may not be real soccer that's not what you're looking for in this. You're looking for pure excitement and this is what this show gives you. I would honestly give this a ten if it wasn't for seasons 2 animation problems. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes anime or even sports. This is what people should call peak.\nMovie_Weeb\nFeb 17, 2025\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nA Thrilling and Unique Soccer Anime Experience\nBlue Lock is a gripping and unique soccer anime series that will captivate both sports enthusiasts and anime lovers alike.

As compared with another sports series, Blue Lock doesn't purpose the team unity. It may be sounds great but actually you can't do anything if you can't go stable with your team. Then i learned the author have already said that he purposed making a sports anime different than \"real soccer\". I really felt like i'm watching anime battling scenes during the matches. The animation is all amazing. But i don't get that why the animation get worse during the second season. And i think the u20 match is the best arc in the manga. At least they tried to make it better to the last episode. Episode 14 was all amazing, i'm not talking about whole of the second season while saying the animation is bad. Thanks to all those who contributed, sincerely.\nidetta\nJan 3, 2025\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nA very surprising story\nSpoiler\nreyanshmittal-45830\nOct 29, 2024\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nScore Big with Blue Lock: The Anime That Will Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat\nFirst off, the animation was fantastic. The way the matches were animated really made them feel intense and thrilling to watch. And Isagi's movements on the field were so fluid and dynamic, it was a joy to see him play.\nSpeaking of Isagi, I really admired his drive and determination to become the best striker. Even when he formed close bonds with his teammates, he didn't let that hold him back from pursuing his own goals. I thought that added an interesting egoistic flavor to the story, which made it more unique and engaging.\nThe concept of the show was really intriguing too. I've never seen an anime about a team of strikers before, so it was cool to see that kind of specialization explored.\nThe only thing I didn't like as much was the limited screen time given to some of the other characters. I think they could have been fleshed out more and given more of a chance to shine. That's why I took off one point from my rating.\nOverall though, I thought Blue Lock was a great anime. The animation, the battles, and the character of Isagi all made for a thrilling and exciting experience. If you're a fan of sports anime, I'd definitely recommend giving it a watch!\nItzz_AARPEE\nMar 31, 2023\nPermalink\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

The only thing stopping me from watching sport animes is that animation and sports cant coexist. If you don't play a sport know It's about quick actions, hesitations, and a frame time to think about the mc thoughts on the field. Which would make the \"moving slideshows\" look better in my opinion. Watch blue lock season 2 (ep2) the switch up sounds for the suspense in this anime might be the best I've ever heard all my life no glaze.shi had me thinkin isagi was cooked until he found a little tiny crack that he can exploit. Idk the creator but this level of thinking is better that the manipulation mc animes. This is the best ur gonna get out off a sport anime.\nultraneshyon\nOct 16, 2024\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nA Mature Anime.\nI'll be a man and accept this, I cried in some episodes. No other movie or TV show has made me cry, ever. This could be because I felt connected to the characters so much, I could see myself going through their emotions, their passion, their determination and most of all, their choices.\nEach character arc is so well done, you see them grow with each episode, discovering new things about themselves as they improve their soccer skills. This is not just anime, this a journey into the human psych, and the range of emotions present inside it. Each emotions presents a new challenge for personal development, which the characters accept, adapt and overcome to move forward.\nThe animation style is well done and music is really good.\nI highly recommend watching this show.\npaulwalters-24\nNov 24, 2023\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\n**Review of *Blue Lock* - A 10/10 Anime**\n*Blue Lock* stands out as a phenomenal anime, earning its well-deserved 10/10 rating. This series takes a fresh and exhilarating approach to the sports genre, particularly football (soccer), by fusing high-stakes competition with intense character development, psychological drama, and unrelenting tension.\nThe story centers around Yoichi Isagi, a talented but unremarkable forward who, along with other promising football players, is thrust into a ruthless training program known as *Blue Lock*. The aim? To find Japan's best striker for the national team by creating a cutthroat environment where only the strongest survive. This premise gives the series a unique edge, showcasing not just the physical but also the mental fortitude required to succeed at the highest level.\nOne of the key highlights is the character development. The anime delves into the psyche of each participant, highlighting their individual goals, insecurities, and transformations. Isagi's journey from a team player to a more selfish and calculated striker is gripping, and his internal conflict is brilliantly portrayed. The varied personalities of the other contestants, each with their own flair and motivations, create a dynamic and engaging atmosphere.\nThe animation quality in *Blue Lock* is top-notch, with fluid, intense action sequences that capture the speed and intensity of football. The camera work and exaggerated movements during key moments - such as shots on goal or tackles - enhance the adrenaline-pumping experience. The visual style overall, along with the unique art direction, helps distinguish *Blue Lock* from other sports anime.\nThe soundtrack also complements the high-energy action. Powerful, fast-paced music intensifies the dramatic moments, while softer, more introspective tracks allow for quiet, character-driven moments. The sound design helps build tension, making every match feel crucial, and every decision made by the players monumental.\nWhat truly elevates *Blue Lock* to a 10/10, however, is its exploration of themes like ego, ambition, and personal growth. The show challenges traditional notions of teamwork in sports, asking: \"What does it take to be the best?\" It doesn't shy away from the idea that an individual's selfishness and desire for personal glory can lead to victory. This moral gray area adds layers to the story and forces viewers to question the value of individualism versus collaboration.\nIn conclusion, *Blue Lock* is an electrifying ride that pushes boundaries both in terms of sports storytelling and character complexity. It's a must-watch for fans of intense competition, gripping narratives, and a fresh twist on the genre. With its memorable characters, stunning animation, and deep psychological undertones, *Blue Lock* solidifies its place as a perfect 10/10 anime.\njyashovardhan\nDec 28, 2024\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\n\" PEAK SHOW !!! \"\nThis Anime change my life . As I sat on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen, I couldn't help but feel my heart racing with every intense moment of Blue Lock. This anime has single-handedly redefined the sports genre, elevating it to unprecedented heights. With its unique blend of psychological thriller elements, stunning animation, and deeply human characterization, Blue Lock has secured its place as a peak show in modern anime.\nBlue Lock's greatest strength lies in its thought-provoking examination of the human psyche. The series delves into the inner workings of its characters' minds, exposing their deepest fears, desires, and insecurities. This introspection makes the characters relatable and authentic, allowing audiences to empathize with their struggles.\n' Those who like Football will loved at peak '\nthanseerx\nNov 3, 2024\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nSomething Innovative\nSports anime is kind of a weird genre for me. I generally don't prefer to watch them as they are kind of predictable and have a typical story. Blue lock also seemed to be a sports anime i went in biased but after watching just the first episode i got hooked. It has many typical anime cliches but they aren't boring at all in fact this anime has one of the best way of storytelling. There is good backstory for most characters and the character development is amazing not only for the protagonist honestly the protagonist is probably has the boring part of character development in the beginning compared to the serious parts. The plot is great and fresh unlike most recent ones it's a great watch even if you don't like sports or sports anime. Sometimes the protagonist character development is kind of too much of talk but the making of an egoist is just too good.\nsathvik-45604\nMar 25, 2023\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nWhat?\nNo words to describe the goosebumps one could get out of this one, like, everything's just there & I've disliked football since birth!

Directed by Tetsuaki Watanabe and based on the manga by Muneyuki Kaneshiro and Yusuke Nomura, the series challenges traditional notions of teamwork in soccer, focusing instead on individual ambition and ego.\nPlot and Premise\nThe story revolves around a groundbreaking and controversial training program called \"Blue Lock,\" designed to create the world's greatest striker for Japan's national soccer team. The protagonist, Yoichi Isagi, enters this cutthroat competition, where players are pitted against one another in a survival-of-the-fittest format. The stakes are high, and the tension is palpable as each player must outwit and outplay their rivals to prove their worth.\nVisuals and Animation\nOne of Blue Lock's standout features is its dynamic and fluid animation. The action sequences are electrifying, capturing the intensity of every shot, pass, and goal. The character designs are distinctive, and the use of lighting and color amplifies the psychological edge of the story, making every moment visually captivating.\nThemes and Characters\nUnlike traditional sports anime, which emphasize teamwork and camaraderie, Blue Lock explores the darker, more individualistic side of competitive sports. The series delves deep into the psyche of its characters, exploring their ambitions, fears, and personal growth. Yoichi Isagi's journey from a team player to a self-assured striker is both compelling and relatable, while the supporting cast adds depth and diversity to the narrative.\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack complements the series perfectly, with adrenaline-pumping tracks that heighten the intensity of key moments. The voice acting is also top-notch, bringing out the emotional nuances of each character.\nVerdict\nBlue Lock is a refreshing and innovative entry into the sports anime genre.

In addition blue lock has a handfull of things it teaches you. It shows you that your willpower isnt enough and that u have to let go of whatever is slowing down your individual progress anything and anyone that proves itself to be a hindrance or liability will be left to dust and the egoism that spreads and envelopes that blue lock facility compelled me enough for me to stick around to see what happens in the show. The presence of these characters radiating with toxic energy is very intriguing and moreover makes the anime and manga more captivating as it builds up hype around the audience its the perfect sports anime for me it gives a new touch to sports anime in general as it was clear that sports anime was overshadowed by many others categories of anime its now widely accepted by many that blue lock is the most prominent sports anime in the anime industry.\naniidrisoled\nJan 7, 2024\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nThis anime should be rated 10 - Something Fresh\nI love, love, love this anime.\nWhen I watched the first 10 minutes, it grabbed me, I thought \"wow this is a refreshing take from all the I am going to be the greatest...??? Stuff\". After the second episode it hit me that this was on another level as an anime and sports anime.\nThe visuals, voice acting and storyline are all there and I have a feeling that the best is yet to come.\nThe ideals are strong as hell and the characters definitely each have a unique flavour of power among them. The best part about it is there is almost no forcefully interjected elements, and it goes a step further in seriousness and gravity.\nThe stakes are high, and I can't wait for a second season.\nextraplay-61838\nSep 22, 2023\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nRecommended!! Blue Lock Review: A Game-Changer in Sports Anime\nBlue Lock is not your typical sports anime. While most series in the genre focus on friendship, teamwork, and heartwarming underdog tales, Blue Lock breaks that mold with a ruthless, high-stakes approach to soccer that feels more like a psychological thriller than a sports story. Created by Muneyuki Kaneshiro (writer) and Yusuke Nomura (illustrator), and brought to life by 8bit Studio in the anime adaptation, Blue Lock is a fresh, intense, and at times brutal dive into the world of competitive sports and ego.\nStory & Concept:\nThe story begins with Japan's national soccer team failing to win the World Cup. In response, the Japan Football Union launches a radical and controversial program called \"Blue Lock,\" designed to create the world's best striker. 300 of Japan's most promising young forwards are locked in a prison-like training facility where only one will emerge as the ultimate striker. The rest? Their soccer careers are effectively over.\nThe idea is bold and unapologetically individualistic, flipping the genre's usual message of \"teamwork makes the dream work.\" Instead, Blue Lock asks: What if you have to crush others to succeed? The story's structure is reminiscent of survival game anime like Death Parade or Danganronpa, but with soccer as the battleground.\nThis setup is what makes Blue Lock so compelling. Every match, every challenge is filled with tension-not just for the action on the field, but for the personal stakes involved. Each player is fighting not only to win, but to exist in the world of football. The psychological pressure is constant, and the show doesn't shy away from showing the emotional toll it takes.\nCharacters:\nAt the center of the story is Yoichi Isagi, a relatively average forward who begins questioning his style of play. He's not the fastest, strongest, or most technically gifted. But as the story progresses, he develops a talent for spatial awareness and vision-essentially becoming a tactical genius. Isagi's journey is satisfying because it doesn't rely on raw talent, but on intelligence, growth, and self-discovery.\nThen there's Ego Jinpachi, the mastermind behind the Blue Lock program. As his name implies, he's all about ego-believing that a true striker must be selfish, confident, and willing to take the spotlight. Ego's lectures are both inspiring and unsettling, serving as philosophical interludes that challenge the characters and the audience alike.\nOther standout characters include Meguru Bachira, the wild and unpredictable dribbler with a passion for playing with \"monsters\"; Rensuke Kunigami, the honorable power-shooter who wants to be a soccer superhero; and Seishiro Nagi, a genius with absurd talent and an infuriatingly lazy attitude. Each player brings something unique, and their clashing personalities add layers of drama to every interaction.\nThemes & Message:\nThe core theme of Blue Lock is ego-not just selfishness, but a sense of identity, confidence, and hunger. In a world where playing safe leads to mediocrity, Blue Lock argues that greatness demands risk, defiance, and an unrelenting drive to win. It's a controversial message, especially for fans of team sports, but one that resonates deeply in competitive arenas.\nThere's also a strong undercurrent of self-exploration. The characters aren't just learning how to play soccer; they're discovering who they are when everything is on the line. The show frequently explores questions like: What kind of player do I want to be? What am I willing to sacrifice for success? Do I have what it takes to shine, even if it means leaving others behind?\nAnimation & Sound:\nStudio 8bit delivers dynamic animation that captures the energy and intensity of each match. The use of visual effects-like the eerie blue aura that represents ego awakening-adds a supernatural flair that makes key moments feel monumental. The character designs are sharp, stylish, and expressive, and the pacing keeps viewers hooked through every arc.\nThe soundtrack, composed by Jun Murayama, is fittingly dramatic, with intense beats and haunting melodies that heighten the suspense. The opening and ending themes also perfectly capture the series' tone: raw, energetic, and a bit chaotic.\nFinal Thoughts:\nBlue Lock is a bold, genre-bending sports anime that refuses to play by the rules. It challenges the status quo with a thrilling mix of athleticism, psychological warfare, and philosophical musings. It's not about who's the nicest or most team-oriented-it's about who wants to be the best, no matter the cost.\nWhile some viewers may find its ideology harsh or even toxic, there's no denying the show's unique appeal. It's a breath of fresh air in a genre that can sometimes feel formulaic. Whether you're a die-hard sports fan or a newcomer to anime, Blue Lock offers an unforgettable ride full of tension, character growth, and high-stakes action.\nRating: 10/10\nHighly recommended for those who love competitive thrillers, psychological depth, and sports with a sharp edge.\nimdbfan-0862154343\nApr 15, 2025\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nMasterpiece 10/10\nI love Blue Lock. It's the antithesis of other sports stories. While sports anime are always about friendship and teamwork, Blue Lock's basis is selfishness and individualism. This makes for a very unique, suspenseful, exciting storyline. The matches in Blue Lock are not ordinary matches, but have the vibes of going to war. Each character has a unique backstory and character, from Rin, Bachira, Igaguri, to Barou. And every technique and concept has real roots in real soccer techniques. I guess the manga author did a lot of research on soccer. I really like Blue Lock and look forward to Season 3, where Blue Lock players will face the brutal and unbelievably high level of the world, 10/10.\nwahyuawaludin\nMar 21, 2025\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nBest Anime for manga readers and beginners\nIt is great the development of the players are fantastic and I love how each episode is about one of the characters so that you learn more about them. The story is very good going from just normal unprofessional footballers to going pro and the end of season two leaves fans guessing this is my favourite anime definitely recommend for beginners manga readers and people just looking for a anime to watch and if you can buy it the mangas are also amazing despite having no colour at all this manga and anime is one of the best and if you have time to read or watch this you will be amazed I hope you enjoy:).\njuppal-77119\nFeb 9, 2025\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\n10/10\nWhy Blue Lock is a 10/10 Masterpiece\nWhen it comes to sports anime and manga, there is no shortage of inspiring stories that emphasize teamwork, camaraderie, and overcoming adversity. However, Blue Lock, created by Muneyuki Kaneshiro and illustrated by Yusuke Nomura, stands out as a unique and revolutionary entry in the genre. It doesn't just reinvent the wheel-it creates an entirely new one. With its innovative approach to storytelling, unforgettable characters, and psychological depth, Blue Lock has cemented itself as a masterpiece worthy of a perfect score.\nA Revolutionary Take on Sports Anime\nAt its core, Blue Lock subverts the traditional sports narrative. Instead of promoting the usual themes of unity and selflessness, it boldly focuses on egoism. The story begins with the Japanese Football Association's quest to win the World Cup by creating the ultimate striker. To achieve this, they establish the \"Blue Lock\" facility, a brutal training program where 300 of Japan's most talented young forwards compete against one another. Only one player will emerge as the ultimate striker, and failure means being banned from representing Japan in the future.\nThis premise is a breath of fresh air in a genre that often adheres to safe, predictable storytelling. By prioritizing individual ambition and self-centeredness, Blue Lock turns conventional wisdom on its head, making every match and interaction feel fresh and high-stakes. It doesn't shy away from exploring the darker sides of competition-the jealousy, desperation, and fear of failure-which makes the characters and their struggles feel more authentic and relatable.\nComplex and Compelling Characters\nThe character development in Blue Lock is second to none. The protagonist, Yoichi Isagi, starts as an average player plagued by self-doubt and indecision. However, as the series progresses, Isagi evolves into a calculating, ruthless strategist who embraces his ego and hunger for greatness. This transformation is deeply satisfying to witness, as it highlights the human desire to grow and overcome limitations.\nBut Blue Lock doesn't stop at just one compelling protagonist. Every player in the facility is given distinct motivations, personalities, and skills that make them memorable. From the egot.\ndawan-17350\nDec 30, 2024\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nAbsolute cinema.\nSpoiler\nncyfzmwc\nDec 30, 2024\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nbest anime sports\nSpoiler\nrnmkrt\nDec 29, 2024\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nBest Inspiring Anime Ever\nIt's the best Inspiring Anime i have ever watched...

Everyone’s sweaty and knackered, rightfully so, the scoreline is 6-6, or at least that’s what you think cause you never really keep track of the score during games. You’re in the penalty box and your best bud passes a beautiful through ball to you. You take a clean touch, fake a shot to the left, and whip the ball into the top right bin. The goalkeeper doesn’t see it coming at all. How could he? The crowd goes wild. A little quieter than normal you note–probably cause you’re at an away\n\n...\n\ngame. The ref blows his whistle, “fweeeeeeet”. The game’s done, you’ve won. You run to the sidelines and your mom hands you your favorite drink, a scrumptious blackcurrant Ribena that was in the cooler only seconds ago. You take a comforting sip and look around. You pinpoint exactly why the crowd was quieter than usual. It’s because your dad was dozing off in the middle of the game. Your mom sees where you’re looking at and gets mad. “JORDAN, how many times do I have to tell you, don’t sleep during your son’s game.” You’re not mad, you understand. He had to drive your ass for an hour and a half at 6am to watch a little league football game on a Saturday morning. You take a look at the other teams bleachers, trying to find the goalkeeper you just styled on. Strange, you can’t quite pinpoint him from the coagulate of jerseys until one of them walks up to you with his mom. His mom says: “hey, that was a great goal, my Kev could have never saved that.” You look at the child in tow, weird, you don’t remember a kid with glasses on the pitch. His mom notices and explains how she doesn’t let her son wear glasses on the pitch in case a ball hits his face. So that’s why he couldn’t save it, he couldn’t damn well see the ball could he? This, this pseudo-thrilling shithousery is Blue Lock to me. \n\nThe start of Blue Lock was actually bearable, dare I even say interesting. Seriously, it’s a good concept on paper. A bunch of ambitious teenagers vying for a chance to become Japan’s national team striker through a rigorous and ruthless training regime with one person remaining. Or that’s what it seemed at the start, until you realize that no characters introduced get eliminated. Or the absurdity of fielding a striker in goal could ever yield effective practice for anyone involved. But I understand there should be an expected level of plot armoring and suspension of disbelief afforded when it comes to these shows so I will give it some leeway. Instead, this review will focus more so on the myriad of reasons why this show doesn’t even work in an entertaining sense. \n\nFirst and foremost, it’s the animation. For some surreal reason, some people actually think the animation in this show is good. The characters are drawn decently and the food looks realistic enough. But most importantly, the actual animation of the football? Really? For the people complaining about the work of the CG in another popular series that aired the same season that I just so happen to adore–You should be up in arms here with knives and pitchforks screaming “Sic ‘em!”; it’s hideous. But the biggest and most heinous animation problem are the still frames filled with exposition that completely ruin the flow of each play. Matches are shown in these constant close ups of the characters slowly gliding across your screen as you hear the play happening in their head. But the play itself is never actually explicitly shown. It's reminiscent of those imovie projects you had to do for middle school where you couldn’t quite figure out how to get the images to stop moving with the ken burns effect as you try your best to match your squeaky dialogue with the 4 second image overlay. It’s an embarrassing production. Football is dynamic and exciting at heart, especially in attacking play. But this static imagery completely ruins the momentum of each play and makes it really hard to sit through some of these moments that I would like to imagine were exciting on paper. If you don’t get the animation right for a sports anime, it’s really hard to build from there. \n\nThe ranking system is atrocious and representative of everything wrong with shonen anime. Why would the ranked 299 person realistically even have a shot at becoming one of the best players. It’s this unnecessary from the bottom to the top type writing that tries to maintain hype through introducing opponents of increasingly high rank. This might work for some, but to me, it’s tedious to sit through knowing that someone with more power but with even less personality will appear and none of this matters. Take Nagi for example. How on earth does he have the ego to say he’s the best player as he’s introduced when he’s ranked 250 something in this facility alone. It’s just meaningless fluff because it’s obvious they’re trying to drum up some kind of idiotic point where he realizes oh he’s not god’s gift and there are people that challenge him here. Then Rin comes along with a similar ego complex, but is just stronger and replaces what little Nagi’s purpose was. The part that really infuriates me is that after what seems like these development arcs for each of these characters. They’re reduced to these shells of their former selves and are added to Isagi’s collection of assets like they’re all tools in Mickey Mouse’s toolbox. “Oh toodles!!! Who will I pass to today?\" As he bring up 4 options to the screen. I can just imagine the kids watching screaming at their screen: “Garou! Kunigami! Bachira! Chigiri!” or whoever else “fortunate” enough to be Isagi’s plaything at this current moment. \n\nStrikers aren't the king of the castle but Blue Lock certainly thinks so. Football is a teamsport; it’s an 11-aside game played on a 105 by 68 meter rectangular field with the objective of putting the ball in your opponents net. The game most importantly is driven by cohesive teamplay. Unlike something like basketball where there is abundant teamplay, but there are also plays that can be started and finished by a single player because the pitch is relatively small. But it’s different in football. There is so much buildup required for each goal. Blue Lock doesn’t have nearly enough of this. I think it’s because of this ignorant “ego” thing they try to drive into each player. The mortifying “chemistry reaction” and “devouring” they keep bringing up as what they believe to be “football”. To anyone who has not seen football, please do not look at this affront and think this is what football’s about. It’s so cringey and it hurts every fiber of my being. \n\nSimilarly, players like Bachira and Chigiri are obviously more suited to be wingers. Yet they’re still pushed into this rigid idea that they’re number 9s. It does a huge disservice to your greats like Kagawa and that legendary Japanese midfielder that people get disappointed when they pack in Fifa. These midfield Maestros are some of your greats, why would you think to disrespect them by saying strikers are the most important position. Take some time to look back at the past few world cups, was Giroud the main reason France won the world cup in 2018? How about Spain’s 4-6-0 formation where they fielded 0 strikers and won the world cup in 2010? It’s just this cringey decadent idea that strikers are the most important part that I just know comes from a place to get impressionable children riled up for your show. Frankly, it’s dishonest and insulting. \n\nAnother crucial problem with only having strikers is, you only have a limited amount of qualities and unique skills to give around where players can excel at: Pace, finishing, hold-up play, off the ball movement, spatial awareness to name the key ones. And evidently, they’re exhausted pretty quickly. What you’re then left with are pure power upgrades that I really dislike. Where it’s this childish one-upping of “I read his play”, “I read his reading of my play”, “I can jump higher than you”, “I can run faster than you”. It’s just not fun to watch from a tactical and footballing standpoint. And deep down, Blue Lock knows this, so what do they do? They decide to introduce imaginary monsters. Yes you heard me right. \n\nJust like Bachira and the monster inside of him, there are 2 wolves inside of me, one hates this show, the other also hates this show. The individual monsters of this show don’t work and don’t get expanded on. When you lean into that supernatural realm without actually doing anything meaningful with it–Or when they don’t iron out properties of these supernatural concepts like in the case of Blue Lock, it just becomes nonsensical mumbo jumbo. You have no limit defining, everything just ends up feeling so pulled out of the hat for convenience sake. It’s also those flaming eyes when the monsters come out or when they enter “serious mode” that are so badly animated for some of these scenes. They all start to look like Endeavor from MHA to me and it’s admittedly hysterical. But from a non-biased critiquing standpoint, it’s abhorrent. \n\nThis menagerie known as the Blue Lock facility also feels so barren and boring. There needs to be an incentive to make this program feel rewarding where players should want to stay here because they’re becoming their best selves. Be it, superior practicing methods, state of the art training equipment, illustrious coaching instructors, you name it. But Blue Lock doesn't have any of this. It just feels like a death trap that unbeknownst to each of the players before they join, if they get knocked out they can never play for the Japanese national team. I feel like these sort of stipulations should have been included in the letter. If not, screw it, just go full squid game and say if you’re knocked out you’re executed. That would have spiced things up a little bit. I also think it’s laughably pathetic how this show is only situated in an air conditioned indoor football pitch as they prepare for a competitive outdoor sport. It’s almost as if these writers couldn’t have borne the thought of not being in an airconditioned room. The world cup and every club football competition is played outdoors. So why are we conditioning these kids to never see the light of day?\n\nI don’t understand why Blue Lock had to introduce made up characters in the series. I understand this point is more a pet-peeve as not everyone that watches Blue Lock is familiar with football and that’s totally fine. But as for me, I’m just wondering why we had to make up characters mixed in with real footballing greats? Noa Noel? Seriously? Noa-ne cares. I had to sit here as they tried to explain white-washed Thierry Henry to me. You should either choose to reference only real life players or make up all the players for your world. Because from where I stand, it just sounds like you’re undermining the two goats of our football generation, Messi and Ronaldo.\n\nThe only thing that I can appreciate in this show are the subtle or not so subtle yaoi elements. It’s the only thing that’s keeping me engaged in this show and I’m not even lgbtq. The series really tries to reach a target demographic here and I for one am happy it succeeds on this front. When Bachira calls out to Isagi to free him from his captors. I shudder at the thought of these 2 loverboys not being together. My favorite line is when Nagi or as I know him as “NTR-gi” says: “Sorry Reo, now that I know how good this feels, I can’t go back to how I was before” (20:59, Ep 20). Gosh, That was a fun episode. They should just do this every episode, feign seriousness and drop these banging sus one liners in the middle of the game. Just start testing the homies, see if you can catch one of them lacking. Alas, these characters have to be serious, they’ve got indoor football matches to play! \n\nLook, if you like Blue Lock, that’s your prerogative and I could never take that away from you. Nor would I want to, everyone’s allowed to enjoy what they want. As a football fan myself, I was massively disappointed that a show I was sold to be this “excellent intense battle-royale football show\" fell so flat on its face. Why can all the other sports get shows like Kuroku No Basuke or Haikyuu!!, and we get this. I’ve seen clips of these other shows and they look phenomenal. It’s just not fair. If you were starved of football content as an anime fan, I’d recommend watching the 2022 World Cup instead of watching this 24 episode choppy passion-devoid mess. That was a real treasure to behold.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheNinthRequiem (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 22, 2022\n\nEllenwitch\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (3/24 eps)\n\n To be the best. You have to work the best, you have to train the best, eat, and sleep the best. Sometimes, it even takes going through extreme measures, in order to find that best out of someone. Even if what is presented, wouldn't be called Football to you. Football may just be a sport to some, but for a load of people it's very serious business. People eat, sleep, dream football. People travel endless miles, travel to different countries, no matter the cost, to watch their team perform. It may be a sport, but it's a lifestyle for so many, to even many nations,\n\n...\n\nwho want to grasp it by the horns, and be the best in the world.\n\nThis is Blue Lock.\n\nBut to be the best, you need to basically start from somewhere, You can't be the best with mediocare, or just good enough level of talent. You have to find the best. Or even make and train the best.\n\nStory and characters: 8\n\nWhile there are flaws within it's story context, as there is a dozen other positions on a football picture, and you cannot win alone as a striker by yourself. Football is a team effort, and here in Blue Lock, they show it in both forms. Points where they'll show how good it is working within the team, but all the while showing the greatest, can do it by themselves. The best get results, the best deliver, where it be on their own, or with a team. It's proven within the game itself. Taking quotes from real footballers, in order to further prove their points.\n\nThe characters within the show are quite bundle. The best players aren't just known for their skills alone, they have the personalities to boot. Sometimes you need the right kind of characters, in order to succeed. You cannot be weak, you cannot be a weak link, you cannot suffer under pressure. With so many conflicting and determined characters within this line up, and with the story it presents. It's going to be a good product. \n\nArt and sound: 8\n\nBlue Lock has an interesting kind of style that sets it apart from different animes. Just by looking through the characters eyes, is proof in the pudding. Hell, some even look a bit soulless. As if there is a massive focus, a massive serious attention from everyone who is in this process. Everyone has the determination to be the best, and if you don't, you're weak, you're out. Simple as that. I've described some shows as having an in your face style, but with Blue Lock, it's more described as a determined seriousness to it. While one may laugh at the idea of Japan ever wining the World Cup, but with how this show is presented. It's no laughing matter to them. The sound quality too, is top notch, and can't put a foot wrong.\n\nBlue Lock is a different spin on a usual Football anime that has come over the last few years. But it's certainly left a very serious, and impressive impression. Give it a watch for sure.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Ellenwitch (\n338\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 26, 2022\n\nBioxer\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (8/24 eps)\n\n Excuse me, wtf?\n\nDo people who didn't like the anime REALLY understand how it works?\n\nDo you really prefer that the \"sport\" genre is ALWAYS THE SAME THING THAT WE ARE TIRED OF SEEING? (And i say this as an absolute sports fan, including animes).\n\nThe next football anime, what will it have NEW if Ao Ashi already addresses everything?\n\nThat's why i like different proposals when well executed, and Blue Lock does it perfectly.\n\nStory: 10/10\n\nIn short, Japanese football cannot progress, they do not have decisive strikers and this is their weakest point, so they need drastic measures to solve this problem, in this way, Blue Lock emerged, which\n\n...\n\naims to create the best striker in the world, the one who will carry the Japanese national team and make the country win the world cup.\n\nONLY HERE we can already see something to be considered, ALL other football animes always have the same idea of ​​\"joining a team and going out trying to win all the championships ahead\", Blue Lock innovates, it manages to stand out precisely because it is different from the others. You can look at it and think that the purpose is empty, but the amount of plots that are happening involving Blue Lock is ABSURD, they are things you would never expect and that's fantastic.\n\nAnimation: 8/10\n\nIt's not perfect like Bleach's animation this season, BUT, it's still extremely good, even more so for a football anime. It presents different angles of view, graphical representations, solid transitions, an art with highlighted lines, and even has the apex moments where the animation becomes surreal, the only questionable thing in my view is the sudden 3D models that may not be to taste from everyone and they can save the budget (but it's still good) like it did in Episode 8, but it's clear that the focus is on the action scenes and that really has to be the priority.\n\nSoundtrack: 8/10\n\nBoth the opening and ending songs in addition to the Ost's are very good, they are not memorable as Haikyu songs, the ones you even want to listen to on Youtube, but they represent the atmosphere of all events well, especially the hype moments omfg.\n\nCharacters/Development: 10/10\n\nPlayers practically have their main skills where they are better than others, but at the same time they evolve their other points to become complete strikers, which is precisely the methodology, a PERFECT striker. The main characters have backstories where things are shown such as why they play football and why they enter the Blue Lock, many of them establish relationships between them, both positive and negative, like conflicts, not everything is a rainbow. Characters have a variety of personalities and appearances, I like, not much to say here.\n\nAnd some quick answers\n\n- Blue Lock has nothing cringe, the dialogues and facial expressions are the essence of the show, it works AND MUST exist\n\n- No, they don't play football alone, in Episode 3 you'll see why that's wrong, selfishness doesn't mean picking up the ball and playing alone, it's just a mix of \"knowing you're capable of deciding the match in hours needed + player confidence + will to win at any cost\" :)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Bioxer (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 22, 2022\n\nDxonice\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (7/24 eps)\n\n So the top reviews from what I read don't understand the story enough to say anything and it shows. With someone even \"reading\" the manga but not understanding anything about it. The story's start point is to create the strongest striker in the world for Japan, that much is straight forward. It is literally the same as \"finding the one piece\" every pirate aside from a few in one piece are trying to be the pirate king. Does that make the story/plot bad? nope. (im not even a one piece fan) \n\nStory: 9/10\n\nLike I said everyone has the goal of becoming the best striker\n\n...\n\nin the world. That doesn't stop people from playing other roles like the biggest reviews say. In the anime the first couple episodes has everyone wanting to play forward so they can score but unfortunately that can't work. They have a \"striker\" play goalie for them every single time, the goalie didn't change so the argument of people don't play different positions is already just wrong. The story also progresses to have every position played because the characters all find what they are good at and use it to their advantage. It doesn't stop them from wanting to be strikers but they still play their positions well. Which is like the biggest point of the entire story throughout all of the manga, is finding what people are good at and making them better. For 99% it doesn't stop them from wanting to be forward and scoring goals but they all understand they have their own strengths. People focus too much on \"they are just trying to make hot characters who kick ball\" instead of how the characters themselves develop and what's good about them. The story is constantly bringing in new characters to enjoy while making them all develop at the same time, doing a really good job of making everyone have their own likeability. \n\nShould you watch/read. 100% \n\nIf you have the mental capacity to not whine because an anime or manga has characters that don't look like rats you will most likely like it. Majority of all characters you are introduced to are unique and have amazing development. I recommend reading the manga if you do read manga's. I have read a lot of manwha/manhua but never manga, outside of :black clover, jujutsu kaisen, kaiju#8, and blue lock:. Out of all the manga I listed blue lock is easily my favorite simply due to the character personalities. Everything else is really good in the story but the characters themselves make it something really great.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Dxonice (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 30, 2022\n\nAnLu11\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (8/24 eps)\n\n I decided to finally make a MAL account purely to write a review of this show, and in all honesty I'm not surprised by the amount of people that called this show \"cringe\" or \"awkward.\" Reading these kinds of reviews make it very apparent that the people writing these reviews are talking from a perspective in which they don't come from a background of playing sports growing up, or specifically playing sports at the highest competitive level.\n\nWith that being said, Blue Lock is probably the most creative show in terms of showing what goes on inside of an elite athlete's mind, taking not only the\n\n...\n\nphysicality required to perform, but also shines light on deep sports psychology. People that call the idea of the \"monster\" inside the players cringe don't realize that during interviews with people like Kobe Bryant and Michael Phelps, they themselves talk about having a \"darkness\" inside them that they tend to tap into when getting into their individual flow states. An entire chapter in a book called Relentless, written by Tim Grover (who was Michael Jordan's performance coach), is dedicated to this darkness that exists only within athletes of the highest level. There are countless other examples of this show getting into different aspects of sports psychology, and at times it gives me chills because of how accurate it can be (which would fly over people's heads if they haven't played sports at a higher competitive level)\n\nSo, for people that would like to explore the truth of elite athleticism and be open to this perspective, Blue Lock is definitely for you. But for those that don't understand what it actually takes to reach the highest levels of sports, where players dedicate their entire being to becoming the best (either because they haven't lived that kind of life or just want to watch this anime comparing it to shows like Haikyuu and Kuroko), then this show really is not for you. \n\nCalling this show unrealistic just teveals that you have not lived a life where you dedicate your ENTIRE being to a sport, which is totally okay, but when giving a review of this show (or starting/continuing it), please take this perspective into consideration.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by AnLu11 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 6, 2023\n\nexvxa\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n Story: Literally non-existent. Each episode resolves of pseudo-developing football skills. The characters get a pass from another player and than stand face o face for 30 seconds and talk toxic redudant bullshit to each other to make sure the one speaking is more alpha than the other.\n\nCharacters: Nothing special here. Typical shounen character set, fancy hair styles. There is the already mentioned pseudo-developing of each character's individual skill set, which some people might find interesting. While this is a shounen anime i can understand this doesn't have to be near to realism, but it gets boring pretty soon. Its a typical schema: Isagi faces a\n\n...\n\nbetter oponent which is depicted as super overpowerd, then he get's an epiphany on his oponents individual skill and tactic set and becomes better in ca. 45min. And this repeats on each story stage. Boring. Only Bachira's stoy background is kind of interesting and supports his development but thats all. The other 40 characters are not very individual to each other, they are all a bunch of toxic, narcistic losers who should better go to college.\n\nMusic: Typical shounen garbage.\n\nDesign: Some chars look cool, most of them have guffy hairstyles. Another boring part about the anime is the surroundings. These wannabes are caged inside a isolated cage. There is nothing, really nothing, that makes this anime in any way beautiful and a piece of art.\n\nAnimation: Literally non-existent. There is maybe 5min of total football animation in this anime, the rest are stand alone pictures. I didnt know time pauses when you play football.\n\nOverall: Bad, redundaant, meaningless shounen anime, A score of 8.25 is blasphemy but shows, how bad anime fans can judge art lmao\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by exvxa (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 26, 2023\n\nQkydzaa\n\nRecommended\nWell-written\n\n Let’s jump straight into the point. Blue Lock is an anime which shows different ways of achieving our goals. Understanding Blue Lock, as simple as it is, is understanding the reasons of different characters to move forward. By no means do I think that the anime is complex or anything. So, what is going on?\n\nCharacters:\n\nEvery character is stereotypical. We got the “goofy” Bachira, main character Isagi, friendly straight-face Kunigami and some edgelords. We’ve all seen these characters before, but all of them have something to share in common. They show us their own way of getting better, moving forward, striving for success. Kuon, for example,\n\n...\n\nwill do whatever it takes to be the last man standing, whether it is morally good or not. Barou – a beast on the field, unstoppable rebellious force- also shares his way to victory. By realizing his mistakes, by finding someone better than him in the field where he should be the “king”, he shows us that, whatever stops him from going forward, he will devour. Haven’t we felt the same way? Whether it is at school or at work, we have always encountered someone better than us. And that really bothers the ego of most people. What do we do then? We get better, and better till we beat that specific person “Those who continue to fight in spite of their despair are bestowed with the power to achieve their dream”-Ego Jinpachi.\n\n Although, we have seen a little from Kunigami, he also has something to say: “If our heads drop down now, we’re done for!”(my favorite quote). Failure is merely temporary and if you accept defeat then you stay knocked down instead of getting back up. Sometimes things don’t always go our way, so press on! Try again and again and learn from failure. Some characters can get you really hyped up, getting goose bumps from what they are saying, and that is the whole point. That is why I admire most of Blue Lock characters. \n\nHere come the problems. As I said in the beginning most of them are stereotypical, so I can’t really find a favorite character from all of them. If it wasn’t for the plot twists, they would be really bland and would fall flat. On top of that, their dictionaries are pretty limited (mine too, but leave that for my profile’s comments), by repeating certain words and phrases over and over again every single episode. Annoying. \n\n8.5/10\n\nPlot:\n\nFairly simple, easy to follow, interesting plot twists and pretty enjoyable to watch. In the middle of the anime, some characters just disappeared, but I guess that we will find out what happened to them at some point. Other than that the plot is smoothly running and most episodes are fairly interesting.\n\n8/10\n\nSound:\n\nFrom the opening theme, to the ending theme every little bit of sound effect is pleasant for the ears. The commercial break sounds, the heavily distorted sounds of shooting, the sound of electricity when characters are on a spree, Barou’s awakening guitar/drums. The sound effects of this anime are clearly made to hype you up, to go outside and kick a football as hard as you can, to beat the person better than you, to finally finish your assignment, to do some actual hard work, or to go back to play some competitive games and give all your best.\n\n10/10\n\nArt:\n\nHere, is where the anime fails. Comparing the art style of the manga and the one of the anime is like comparing Berserk manga to the latest adaptations. Throughout this review I have praised the anime for hyping me up, but just by looking at the animation and art style the hype lasts a couple of seconds. The sparks and colorful mist around players is so poorly made. I understand the reason behind them, but just seeing the poor quality really ruins their whole existence. The 3D is just as horrible and noticeable as most of other 3D animations in anime. On top of that, the art is really just made to be commercially successful. 8bit really did not try to put the soul of the manga in the adaptation. After all we want hollow emotionless white eyes and impactful shots, which we do receive, but the budget version of it. \n\n6/10\n\nI have skipped some unnecessary parts, such as voice actors and illogical moments, the reason being that I find them not that impactful on the whole anime ( they don’t kill the vibe or make things better).\n\nOverall: 8\n\nDon’t get me wrong here. The overall score is just the overall enjoyment and fulfillment after finishing the anime. For me a good anime is an anime, which can make a person change or understand new things, such as worldviews and mindsets. Blue lock made me play football again ( not for long, I guess), made me continue with my work and not just slack off. This is a temporarily feeling, but I love that it exists.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Qkydzaa (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 25, 2022\n\nExamine\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n The reviews for this series have been quite polarising, and essentially you can separate based on one factor:\n\n- Whether the viewer has ever played a sport competitively or not.\n\nThe drive for self-improvement, the need to win - Blue Lock as a series provides a multifaceted view of this idea via its main cast. If you have played a sport competitively (at any level really), then you'll be able to understand and empathise better with many of the characters. Unless you've experienced a competitive setting yourself, it'll be hard to really enjoy what makes each character tick and just write it off as unpalateable.\n\nIt really doesn't\n\n...\n\nmatter whether sports anime would \"conceptually\" make sense in real life either (see Kuroko no Basket, Hajime no Ippo, Haikyuu!, etc) because having anime as a medium itself allows for more flexibility for the entertainment of the viewers. It doesn't make sense for someone to tune into a sports anime just to make sure that everything is accurate to real world rules to a tee.\n\nPersonally, I like Blue Lock because it brings me nostalgia to those days and it's an easy watch that you don't have to think too deeply about. It's exciting, it's enjoyable seeing every character develop on both a \"football\" level and a personal level, and you really do end up waiting week-to-week in anticipation on what will happen next. In my opinion that's all you need in a series really.\n\nIt's fine if you find this series cringe, but having an inability to empathise with any of the characters just tells me you've never worked hard to try to be the best at something (which is fine, your life and all).\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Examine (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 26, 2023\n\nCarlosAlberto\n\nNot Recommended\nWell-written\n\n Imagine yourself as one of the professional Japanese football players on the national team, and they just returned home after an exhausting World Cup game against Croatia, which ended in a 1-1 (3-1 on penalties) win for Croatia. They're frustrated that they couldn't make it any further and ended up being eliminated before the quarter's finals yet again. They turn on their TV, and the anime being exhibited is one about football; the very first line they hear is from a character named Jinpachi Ego; he's basically saying that Japanese football sucks because they lack a good striker, and that is due to the Japanese\n\n...\n\nbeing too unenthusiastic, lacking ego, or greater desire to score goals, and this is what prevents Japan from progressing in football; he also trash-talks Japanese football and its players in general. It comes out that this anime/manga is extremely popular and well-received in Japan. After thinking about the amount of time spent on training and preparation just for that day and moment—an opportunity that comes only in a span of 4 years—how would you feel?\n\nThat's the problem with Blue Lock: aside from being a complete disaster at everything it does, all it does is shit on and disrespect Japanese players, football, and footballers in general, especially the ones that are not strikers. Blue Lock just doesn't respect the concept of sport or competition at all.\n\nThings that make a good sports anime/manga is how inspiring it can be, how connected you feel to the characters, how genuine it feels, and being able to see different perspectives and takes on that sport. Take Haikyuu as an example, a really good manga that helped boost volleyball popularity in Japan, inspiring people all over the world and inspiring people who have now become professional main leads for the national sports team. Then on the other side, there is Blue Lock, doing everything it can to go against it, to be different, unique, fun, creative, and to reinvent the whole genre by deconstructing all the themes and narrative tropes of this genre. That is what Blue Lock imagines itself to be on paper, but reality is far worse than that.\n\nOn top of having a gay subtext, something anyone can notice in this show is how it tries to appeal to popular things to make it sell. Like the bishounen, femboy-ish, ultra edgy looking characters in order to appeal to teenagers and fujoshis, the Battle-Royale concept, why not? is popular, right? I mean, Fortnite and all that shit, and of course the World Cup, like come on, the manga started its release right after the 2018 World Cup ended and the anime aired alongside the 2022 World Cup, so it's clear that Blue Lock is just a commercial attempt at success without any care for substance, fun, passion, creativity, or any form of artistic value, and on that they succeeded, so congrats, after all, this is what Blue Lock IS about.\n\nA facility that allows three hundred strikers to compete against each other to \"create football from zero\", whatever the fuck that means, and create the best striker in the world in order to win the World Cup. The concept that Blue Lock has of a great striker is that of a spoiled child who doesn't want to pass the ball and only wants himself to score the goals. By defining narcissistic and egocentric behavior as a good thing in a sport, all it does is a detriment to the sport itself, but that is the philosophy of Blue Lock. Going through a basic level progression while the matches are played to decide who is going to be eliminated as you just pray for this torment to end.\n\nThe characters are constantly overreacting, delivering lines that don't match the tone of the situation or that are just blatantly stupid. The interactions are also lazy and poorly conceptualized; they constantly trash talk and give each other silly nicknames to show competitiveness. As the matches go on, the show develops their relationship, but that is also done in a very inorganic way. They all have some unique trait or ability that makes them useful in matches, and that is explored in the most superficial way possible. The show always feels the necessity to explain some plays through exposition; right after the play is made, a character will have a monologue where he explains exactly what you just saw, and the anime also makes use of visual explanation for that, so in case there is a toddler watching, they can also understand what just happened, thanks Blue Lock.\n\nThere is no referee, no penalty, no offsides, and no throw-in. There are around 3 fouls, free kicks, and corner kicks in total. A really flabbergasting and exceptional use of the football rules. The author also shows us his incredible knowledge of football by using the most basic football junior tactics and hammering the same three names everytime he wants to use a real player as an exemple—it's always Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Neymar, with Pelé being mentioned only once—names that only the real football fans will get to recognise.\n\nThe show presents us with terrible characters in order to have a pseudo-development later on; you can see that on a lot of MC, like Eren Yeager for example, it gives you a false impression of progress; a character who once was an absolute piece of shit and now it's tolerable feels like a good development, and that's the case with our great protagonist, Isagi Yoichi. The other characters are just as you would expect: caricatures and archetypes that you've seen a thousand times in other shows, just tools to help Isagi in his \"journey\" to become the best striker that plays alongside other strikers in a game with no rules inside a prison facility. The long, red-haired delicated character that relies on speed; the emotionless white-haired prodigy that learns to like the sport; a traitor who wants to win by exploitation of the rules because he sucks and he knows it but also regrets it and is forgiven later; a temperamental, loud blonde guy that is very egocentric but agrees on what others tell him to do; a femboy cringe lord that acts very silly and so on. No one really cares about who gets eliminated because none of the characters are interesting enough for anyone to give a fuck about them. The only one that has a little bit more emphasis than Isagi is Bachira, with his insanely cringe monster allegory.\n\nThe production on this anime is trash; after around episode 5, things just went downhill. Lapses of decent animation, super exaggerated moves that don't convey the technique of the supposed move correctly, poor use of CGI—they even use CGI on still frames that lasted more than 5 seconds on the screen—how lazy is that? Sure, the character designs are detailed, but that is an exigence coming from a manga that has supposedly detailed art and character design, and that, on top of the lack of great animators on the staff, doesn't help the animation fluidity at all. It's super repetitive; everything plays out the same, and they don't even try to do something differently. The direction is super uncreative; you don't get anything unique or interesting; it's always the same perspectives and the same angles of the characters in CGI chasing after the ball and stand still animation. The OST is very forgettable. Also, what the fuck is that additional time garbage that shit is not funny it's just painful to watch.\n\nOne may try to argue that Blue Lock is mindless fun and that it's not taking itself seriously, but that is not true given how edgy and over the top Blue Lock is. It's not a satire of sports manga, nor is it presented in an unpretentious way; it's the complete opposite. The only reason that Blue Lock may feel like that sometimes is because it is so unbelievably bad that you can't accept it for what it is without making up a reason for it.\n\nIf you really want a football anime, the only one I can recommend to you is Ao Ashi. It's not exceptional, but it's WAY better than this shit\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by CarlosAlberto (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\notherdummy\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n Winter 2023 is by no means a great season for anime, but from the very beginning I had my eyes dead-set on reviewing two anime. They were Oniichan wa Oshimai and Mahou Kakumei. But something called Real Life™ got in my way, and instead of writing shit, I spent my free time lying in bed, catching up on desperately-needed sleep time, half-awake and half-dreaming about some giant-ass pumpkin patch. It was pumpkins as far as the eye can see, with the hills and the valleys and the far-off mountains all textured with delicate orange stripes. Well, fuck pumpkins, fuck sleep, and fuck real life. Who\n\n...\n\ncares about anything else when you can watch Blue Lock? It’s objectively the best football anime of Fall 2022 and Winter 2023 and it’s pointless to even consider a 2nd place. So now to answer the all-important question for the readers of this review: What is this anime about?\n\nBlue Lock starts when our power-of-teamwork guy Isagi passes the ball to his teammate instead of shooting for himself and his teammate misses. Isagi then starts pondering if teamwork is hella overrated, and before you know it he is whisked away to the wonderful world of Blue Lock, where the goal is not to work as a team, but by becoming the single best striker in the world. And how is our now-not-so-power-of-teamwork guy Isagi gonna do this? Well, first he has to win matches in teams of 11… and then win more matches in teams of 2-5, and if he succeeds he gets to play in a better team of 11… wait… something doesn’t seem quite right, let’s try something else.\n\nBlue Lock starts when our not-actually-power-of-teamwork guy Isagi passes the ball to his teammate instead of shooting for himself and his teammate misses. Isagi then starts pondering if teamwork is hella overrated, and before you know it he is whisked away to the wonderful world of Blue Lock, where Isagi’s current understanding of “teamwork” is immediately thrown in the trash. Our reformed-power-of-teamwork Isagi, throughout the trials and hardships of Blue Lock, comes to realize that teamwork is not about passing the ball to his teammate in any situation, but instead knowing the strengths and weaknesses of each player and working with that, to generate “chemical reactions” that play to the strengths of each player… wait, timeout, hold on a second.\n\nIsn’t this “chemical reaction” thing just the plain run-of-the-mill definition of teamwork?\n\nWhen you look at Blue Lock more closely, it turns out not to be the “revolutionary approach” to football that it boasts itself as. Instead, Blue Lock’s goal is to explain very basic concepts of football in the most overcomplicated way possible to make it sound like something really cool. Like, what is “smelling a goal”? It sounds really cool, but when we translate it from Isagian to English it turns out to just be “coming up with a winning strategy”. What about “turning zero into one”? It’s just learning how to play in a team instead of individually. And what does “awakening” mean? Easy; it means “shounen shenanigans”. Concepts such as consistency and luck are overexplained in the most overexplanatory way possible that when you realize this, this show starts to be painful to watch. The “character development” is nothing but a contrived sense of progression that is randomly bullshitted by the author with the idea that “if you throw enough bullshit, some of them might not be seen as bullshit”. There’s simply nothing to be found.\n\nWell, if the character development is nonexistent, then at least we can settle for just the characters themselves, right? Well, no, not really. Isagi is basically a reprinted shounen character who says things like “I have to get better” so often that he skips sleep to say it more. Bachira’s characterization is that he can dribble, he is cute, and he can be shipped with Isagi. Ego is a character who spouts off some random shit and also eats random shit. Chigiri has long legs and long hair. Raichi has spiky teeth and spiky hair. Nagi’s characterization is that he can do weird kicks, he is cute, and he can be shipped with Reo. They are pretty much just shounen characters, each with strange “superpowers” that no ordinary high-schooler could possibly have, constantly talking about winning and shit.\n\nSo what’s the point of Blue Lock? It fails at plot, fails at characters, fails at OST (it’s generic as shit). But there’s one thing it doesn’t fail at, and that is making cute, shippable characters. Take Bachira. His VA is talented and adds a considerable amount of nuance to Bachira’s dialogue. But what is this nuance used for? Better character exposition? Reflecting Bachira’s emotional state in a non-obvious way? These are forlorn hopes. The nuance’s sole intention is to make Bachira cuter and more shippable. Nagi’s backstory makes no sense: he only practiced for 6 months and is already a living god at technique. But the story’s intention is not realism; Nagi hence seems more mysterious, so he can be contrasted with Reo better, so they can be shipped together better. The whole purpose of Blue Lock is to ship cute boys together. At the time of writing (just after last episode) there are 3067 Blue Lock fanfictions on AO3. 2643 of them are categorized as M/M fics, of which 473 just so happen to be rated explicit. There are 778 Reo/Nagi fics, 382 Bachira/Isagi fics, 375 Isagi/Rin fics, and many more consisting of all sorts (and forms) of ships. Comparatively, Okabe/Kurisu from the fan-favorite Steins;Gate has only 178 fics to its name; that is less than the 225 Putin/Medvedev fics that exist somewhere on this site. So we can say, with certainty, that Blue Lock was invented to ship cute boys together. Maybe we can go further: Men’s sports manga was invented to ship cute boys together. Fuck it, let’s go even further. Men’s sports was invented to ship cute boys together. Men were invented to ship cute boys together? At this point I don’t know anymore. Perhaps I’ve been ridden to insanity over writing this review, juggling real life, and watching this show. Who knows.\n\nSo with all that said and done, let’s try this one last time.\n\nBlue Lock starts when our cute shounen boy Isagi passes the ball to an irrelevant character and loses the game. The plot don’t matter, the details doesn’t matter, but Isagi becomes tired of his surroundings, and before you know it he is whisked away to the wonderful world of Blue Lock where he can meet other cute shounen boys for the audience to ship and scream random shounen stuff about self-improvement and winning that sounds really, really cool. As Isagi powerlevels, he can meet more cute boys and scream about more bullshit stuff, and the cycle continues until Isagi has all the qualities essential of the world’s #1 striker: know every cute boy on the planet, and be able to scream out the most overcomplicated form of every concept that ever exists. And if a story like that isn’t worth watching, I don’t know what is.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by otherdummy (\n9\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 20, 2023\n\nsmol_minnies\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n The beginning was very promising. The whole idea behind Project Blue Lock seemed interesting, though from a realistic point of view quite foolish and childish. \n\nHowever my main gripe with this show was the pacing. During every match and without failure, every move and thought process is over-explained and over-analysed until all the momentum of the previous action gets lost. It's all build-up without peak, which in turn just leaves you frustrated and unfulfilled. \n\nTo make things worse, they just just had to add melodrama on top of it all. Why are these teenagers dramatically breaking up with each other, or in some cases with\n\n...\n\nthe monster inside of them? Why are they all having an existential crisis in the middle of the match? Even our main guy Isagi, cosigned with the one and only Ego as an Average Joe, dismantles and rebuilds himself every episode or so. This guy just took learn and adapt to a whole new level. \n\nAlso the damn vocabulary used in this anime makes me want to bite my fingers off from the second hand embarrassment. How can these guys talk about being a hero or a king, about creating \"chemical reactions\" together, about \"devouring\" each other and not just die from cringe?? Well I guess they're teenagers after all and well that's as good of an excuse as any for such behaviour.\n\nNow, the animation was all over the place. Awkward still frames and rigid CGI on some parts, but fluid 2D and stunning visuals on others. The art definitely played a huge role in saving the day as it's quiet phenomenal. Character design is absolutely stunning and leaves nothing to complain about. \n\nLastly, Ego. This guy single-handedly carrying the title of the biggest bitch on this show. Every time he opens his damn mouth, I wonder how come he made it alive so far when he's just begging for a beating. \n\nFor a football anime, Blue Lock was more talking than ball kicking but well it had its fun moments which saved it from being an utter bore to watch.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by smol_minnies (\n11\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 4, 2023\n\nsoesoe21\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n This is my first time writing a review lol, so bear with me + this is all MY OPINION :) \n\nTo be honest, these other reviews calling blue lock trash are quite confusing and a bit tasteless. I mean compared to other sports anime, Blue lock takes a different approach and brings something new to the Table, like and anime that is based only on strikers is quite cool. Yeah some people may say oh why is it only focused on that, without watching the rest, but along the story we do see the importance of other positions on the team, so that is a\n\n...\n\nnew approach. \n\nFor something to be interesting it doesn't always have to be complex, sometimes simple and straightforward storylines like the one Blue lock has is all we need. \n\nRegardless of its flaws or what people say, I am very much enjoying this, and this is coming from someone who plays sports (soccer included).\n\nIn conclusion Blue Lock is cool, so give it a try lol.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by soesoe21 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 28, 2022\n\nHanabeedoto\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (10/24 eps)\n\n I saw 1 reviewer criticized negative reviews of this film because those people having 0 experience in \"playing a sport at the highest level\"? HAHAHAHA, I am a retired semi-pro E-sport player back in 2012-2016, and my role was something similar to a striker in Football. \n\nAnd I can tell you that this anime is absolute dogshit for promoting selfish behavior in a sport, as I had a similar attitude of how to become the best in my game is being selfish but it's all wrong the more I play the game. I used to be somewhat of a genius in my game with\n\n...\n\n0 experience of playing the previous sequel of my game, but within 2 years I reached the top rank and had my name on the leaderboard of North America and South East Asia servers, which is super rare, as most pros took at least 5 years to get where they are. \n\nThe idea of having 1 star player to carry the whole team is simply trash and unrealistic to the point of annoying, as being a superstar means that you need to be able to shine alone but at the same time be able to push and help your teammates improve their games.\n\nBack in my day, I also think that in order to climb up the leaderboard and make the name for myself, you should only focus on myself by improving my fundamental skills, and yes it is somewhat true but it only works when you are playing at a lower level. Once you reach a certain level, the skill gap between players is extremely tight, so you need each position to be always at their top form. The idea of putting a sole striker to dribble past 10 players and score goals is honestly an insult to any sports fans and to people who have experience in playing any team-based sports or esports. \n\nBlue Lock has the corniest and cringiest dialogues I have ever seen in any Anime series, those lines simply have no meaning and too cliche. I get the idea of making all the characters look cold and cool, but it didn't work out the way it should. \n\nTBH, don't waste your time watching this anime...

All of this coupled with a dark aura (technically edgy. and it's awesome) makes the anime something unique, making a sport seen as \"simple\" (without analyzing it too much, since all sports have a lot of\n\n...\n\ncontent) into something absurd. , but entertaining and fun. As the characters threaten each other with death for the simple fact of having lost the ball or because they are simply jerks, but each one is unique, thus having their own weapon, differentiating them from the rest (along with part of their attitude, aura and representative color and further).\n\nNow I would like to talk more in depth about the series, setting aside the context and the amazing (and edgy) characters.\n\n-FIRST, the animation... this causes a lot of commotion, it is true that it is not up to what it should have had, but some scenes are visually incredible, and the drawing almost never disappoints, to improve would be the use of cgi (for background characters or far shots) and still images with the ball moving or with sound effects or something that makes it appear that the image is moving.\n\n-The first and second arc, the first and second selection... are quite good. The material is entertaining (the second half seemed like a video game to me, and I love it) and it makes new characters or characters that hadn't been seen before shine and become very fond of them, each one having their moment of prominence. Although they are little compared to what will come in future seasons (hehehe).\n\n-And lastly... the amazing and mostly overlooked (by vast majority though it may not seem like it) amazing music and OST's. BLLK's OST's are incredible, they give a lot of emotion to the scenes and make you feel motivated, or scared, like many of Rin's OST's, causing a feeling of danger to the viewer. And then, that it is not important in the reviews, the Openings and Endings. To start with, the 2 Op and Ed have great animation and amazing music, even though the first Op is controversial because it doesn't reflect much of BLLK (the lyrics do it perfectly, but we're not Japanese and we understand almost nothing or nothing), and then there is the madness of the second Op, Judgment, with a quite innovative and new artistic section, as well as a very good song by the group ASH DA HERO.\n\nBeyond this there is not much more to say about Blue Lock, the truly good is yet to come and we are not prepared for it, luckily everything manages to live up to it.\n\nIf you have come this far, I thank you and I hope you support my review, I wish you a great day.\n\n(I don't speak English very well, so much of this review has been done with a translator, I hope I didn't mess it up and that your eyes didn't hurt from reading some mistake, once again I say goodbye, thanks for reading).\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Jhavibi (\n14\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 19, 2023\n\nmillion_boxes\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n Look, I keep hearing about how Blue Lock isn't supposed to be inspirational, realistic, or like football at all. \n\nFine. But what is it supposed to be? If you want to drop the tried-and-true formula of friendship, teamwork and positivity for something new, I'm all for it. But what IS that something new? Teenagers being jerks to each other and staking their careers on a maniacal guy's training program? Point is: I'm not really sure how this thing's supposed to bring me enjoyment.\n\nLet's get into some specifics: The characters. Despite how the show seem to pride itself on subverting sport anime tropes, its protagonist is\n\n...\n\nyour typical loud, brash idiot who starts off with very mediocre physique and technique but a very useful ability. In this case, it's his ability to visualise the field and foresee moves. This is all fine and all, but because the setting of the story has all but destroyed football as a concept for 'subversion', the protagonists can't use actual theory and gameplan to overcome opponents the way people in Ao Ashi, or Haikyuu, or Ace of Diamond does it. Instead, Isagi simply 'smells' out goals, while his talented friend Bachira listens to 'the monster in his head'. Fantastic. \n\nThe execution of the story also got on my nerves. This is a very subjective thing so I'll just list out my issues here: Overuse of metaphors. These guys cannot stop talking about weapons and formulas and chemical reactions and it's starting to annoy me, especially with the lack of concrete details. I'm not looking at sports anime to because a master strategist at football, but if they're going to ramble, I'd appreciate it if they make it actually informative instead of useless vague monologues. This hyperfixation on 'my weapon' is annoying as hell, because it leads to some truly dumb moments such as how Isagi, despite apparently being able to learn the footwork to get behind an opponent in seconds, didn't bother to try learning it because he was so fixated on doing stuff to 'his weapon'. \n\nSpeaking of metaphors, I'm not a fan of how the things in their mind are literally drawn out: I don't need to see literal chains to understand Chigiri's struggle, nor do I need to see a broken and battered court reminiscent of a battlefield just because some character treats this like combat. \n\nSome of the characters are truly insufferable. Isagi perpetually sounds like he's on the verge of crying when he's trying hard. Most of the most talented guys are needlessly rude and intent on shoving the MC's uselessness in his face. And people like Kuon act like realising 'being selfish is the key to survive in blue lock' means they've discovered the secrets to the universe. Then there's the two Wanimas...I mean, these annoyances (Isagi excluded) are few and far between, but when they do show up, they make sure they take up a large portion of the screentime. Not a single event can happen in-game without the Wanimas cackling in the most obnoxious way possible.\n\nGood things: some of the characters are pretty fun. The animation is solid, especially when it showcases some of the more talented player's technique. I love the animation of Bachira's footwork and Nagi's control.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by million_boxes (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 12, 2022\n\nJJerAx\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (6/24 eps)\n\n The amount of haters I see is actually crazy, as somoene who read and is caught up with the manga I can confidently say that blue lock is going to be one of the most enterntaining shit ever. Now, I myself is not a football fan which is probably a good thing when it comes to blue lock. as we all know blue lock is an unrealistic potrayal of football and to be honest I'm quite happy that it is because im not just about to watch an anime for it to just show people kicking balls, thatd just be so boring. As a\n\n...\n\nfootball ANIME, it very much delivers because again its an anime. anime isn't medium known for its realism but theres certainly realisitc anime out where however, expecting a battle shounen anime to have realism in terms of football is just plain stupid. A lot of people say the dialogue is cringe because it doesnt fit in the genre of football, but like I said it isn't really real life football its anime football. So if you're somoene who likes battle shounen, or just sports ANIME then you should definitely give blue lock a try it wont disapoint. if you have more spare time try reading the manga since its a lot more consistent, and every chapter of it is enterntaining and wont bore you.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by JJerAx (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 2, 2024\n\nCurlybrace101\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\nWell-written\nPreliminary\n\n (11/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock is not a sports anime. Blue Lock is a sports-flavored action show that uses its “sport” to peddle absolutely backwards ideas that make no sense. I am convinced that the author of Blue Lock is an alien who came to Earth and only learned about both soccer and human society by watching Japan's losing games.\n\nThe premise of Blue Lock is that a national soccer training program is instated in which a bunch of the nation's best young male soccer players are trapped inside a facility that treats them like prisoners, withholding basic rights and amenities unless they prove that they’re better than everyone\n\n...\n\nelse at soccer by trusting no one and prioritizing themselves rather than working as a team. Players slowly get eliminated until only the best remains, and if you get eliminated, you are banned from soccer forever and your career is over.\n\nThat is batshit insane. It sounds like an absolute nightmare of a setting that can only be used to tell a horror story satirizing certain philosophical and political ideologies. But somehow, it's not; it's presented as The Way To Win Soccer. But let's put a pin in that. First, let's look at this absolute inane setting for a sports anime and ask the obvious question: why?\n\nWell you see, it's because Big Soccer is convinced that the reason Japan hasn't won the world cup is because everyone is too focused on teamwork when what they really need is the best striker ever who only cares about his own glory and winning, because the striker is the most important role and the team exists to back him. The purpose of this program is to simultaneously train Japan's best striker and weed out all of the other people who are not Japan's best striker and as such are effectively worthless. \n\nThis is accomplished by having all of the characters act as strikers and run an internal competition of who can score the most goals individually, because the real winners aren’t those on the winning team, but those who scored the most goals out of their team, regardless of if your team won or not. They’re motivated to work against their teammates to score more individual goals by rewarding those goals with privileges such as nutritious food, a bed to sleep on, and contact with your family. The goal isn't really to get better at playing soccer (because in order to do that you need to see your teammates as equals), but rather to get better at being the best striker alone by yourself, because then the rest of the team will just have to follow your lead. Teamwork makes the dream work but only when the team are not equals and act under the guidance of the singular best guy. Yes, this plan is how you win soccer and it’s going to train the single guy who will single handedly win the world cup for Japan.\n\nNow, I may have spent my high school years in the school's auditorium rather than on the field, but even I know that not only is that not how soccer works, but the game would fall apart if people tried to play it that way. The author really said \"you know that team sport where the entire point is working as a team and that's always how it has been and there are eleven players who all have different jobs to do for a reason? Actually it's a load of bullshit and the striker is the only important role and it always has been, so he should do whatever he wants forever and all of the other roles are for losers\" This makes no sense if you think about it for more than three seconds. The goal of soccer in Blue Lock is not to win soccer—not really. It’s to be better than other people. And that is an insane goal to have in your show about a team sport.\n\nNow it's time to take that pin out. While the man in charge of this program is presented in a creepy manner, he is also presented as being right. The show has such a grim, mean, violent tone, but rather than playing it for horror and using it to satirize the ideas it presents (such as our society placing one's worth only on their ability to achieve, how the people in power got there by throwing other people under the bus, and how it claims the only reason you have failed is because you didn’t work hard enough), it presents this excessively heavy tone of pain and suffering as beneficial and character-building. \n\nYou were put in an unfair situation that it would have been near-impossible to escape from because you were given an incredibly short amount of time? Well that’s your fault! Here are all of the ways you could have escaped from it but didn't—broken down in detail to show that I am right—and the reason you failed is because you didn't work hard enough, so your entire career is over. You are also the one character who was criticizing my ideas because you, as a sane normal soccer player, value teamwork. I am the one who knows how to actually win soccer, and the next 23 episodes are all going to be people getting better at soccer using my backwards, anti-teamwork, hard-work-fallacy endorsing ideas.\n\nI think my least favorite example of this deeply flawed and illogical ideology is the fact that, as it is presented, the stronger players are given better living conditions, training facilities, and food, and the weaker players are told that if they want to live in those same comfortable conditions, they have to work hard to achieve them. This is bullshit, because in reality, giving the strong players better conditions just makes them stronger, and giving the weaker players worse conditions just makes them worse. It’s actually more complicated than that but I don’t want to mark this review as a spoiler. All that matters is that Blue Lock endorses this idea. The weak players are told they just have to work hard to advance upward so they can live in good conditions, as if the truth of that situation wouldn’t lead to the lack of those good conditions making it impossible to advance. Hmmm…I wonder what this reminds you of? \n\nJust keep pulling on those cleat laces, I guess—just like one of the best strikers in the world who rose out of poverty just by working really hard at soccer! \n\nI don’t even buy the yaoibait team camaraderie it’s trying push so it can masquerade as a sports anime; the blue lock program discourages teamwork by rewarding the players who score the most goals with access to basic rights, and it is making them all work toward the goal of being the singular person to graduate the program with their career still intact because they were better than every other player including all of their previous teammates. I do not buy a friendship formed by encouraging a fellow player to overcome his career ending injury when his motivation for overcoming it is “so I can be better than everyone else.”\n\nI can’t believe in any of these friendships, the inspiring kind where they encourage each other not to give up and celebrate as a team when they win, when this show also includes members of the team double-crossing each other for their own individual goals—which the program encourages because they think soccer is best won when led by a striker who prioritizes his glory over all else. The lunatic running this program explicitly says that one’s individual goals are all that matters, and he as such rewards the teammate that betrayed them. The characters overcome this struggle not by protesting the unfair system, but just by working harder. Then the episode ends with them talking about how awesome it is to live in fear because it makes them stronger.\n\nThe blue lock institute aims to breed fear in the hearts of its players—fear of having their lives ruined because they failed at their career—with the man in charge very explicitly saying that their players are failing because they were never taught to associate success with survival, so blue lock is here to reeducate them. And the players proudly say that they are glad they operate under fear because it leads them to success. According to Blue Lock, it is a good thing to live in fear of your own survival because it is the only true motivator to succeed, and that’s terrifying.\n\nEarly on in the show, the question is asked: “is it worth it to ruin the lives of 299 athletes just for the sake of one?”\n\nThe response?:\n\n“Ruin their lives? Why shouldn’t we? It’s what we need to move forward!”\n\nAnd that, I think, sums up the inherent flaw that is Blue Lock’s design.\n\nBlue Lock is a highly inaccurate and laughable portrayal of soccer used to push the idea that in this messed up world, one should only think about themself and never care for others, because that's the only way to accomplish your goals, and if you cannot do it then the only explanation is that you did not work hard enough. And living like this is good, because it makes you stronger. The sheer horror of the blue lock program would be perfect for criticizing the individualist mindset, but rather it drives it home as true.\n\nBut the reality is that it isn’t true in the slightest. Historically, every time society has operated under this logic, it has failed. The earliest sign of civilization is a healed femur.\n\nThe author of Blue Lock not only doesn't know how soccer works, but he doesn't know how the world works either.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Curlybrace101 (\n54\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 29, 2022\n\nDenying\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (8/24 eps)\n\n The plot is dumb, the characters and dialogue are over the top and awkward, and the football isn't actually football.\n\nBasically, this show is mad cringe, and that's what makes it so great.\n\nIf you came in here looking for thought provoking narratives, or interesting and dynamic character arcs, or even just actual Football then it fails in all aspects.\n\nHowever, if you're an avid enjoyer of fun like I am then this show is a very good time.\n\nThe energy this show gives off is just great, from the overdramatic character monologues to the unapologetically cringe dialogue, it fits the setting and plot to a T.\n\n(Side note: If\n\n...\n\nyour main issue is that the plot is cringe and stupid, the premise is literally Football Squid Game.)\n\nThe animation, top notch.

Every sprint, pass, or defense maneuver is animated with either terrible CGI or just uses still frames or default running animation for it. \n\nCmon guys, the football I love is not just about scoring, It is the most important factor yes, but not the most important variable.\n\nPlot 9/10\n\nAs I said Blue lock from the get-go, had immense potential, but only as a sports-based anime. It Is NOT a real football anime. Though I will admit they took out (very arguably but sadly true) the best aspect of football which is the striker, dramatized it, by making the main character be actually good at his game but just lacking the final piece in most games. added real stakes to it by having a battle royale kind of formula where each loss has real and sometimes permanent consequences, and still manage to have many colorful side characters who arent just plot devices but real threats and competitors to our main Protag who nearly always steal the cake from him. Some of my most memorable moments and high-octane goosebumps have been thanks to blue lock and the final few episodes with isagi vs top 3 were probably the only time a sports anime made me actively grin from ear to ear. It is a flawless combination of tales of passion, talent, hard work, and the concept of winning and losing.\n\nCharacters 9/10\n\nMany memorable and passionate young players each have a talent in them that differentiate them from dreamers and makes them achievers who are ready to put their trust, experience and even friendship on the line to achieve what they want, each character is quirky in their own way and one would easily love their interaction during blue lock additional time. Some of the characters are quite animyfied and do break the realm of realism at times (the brothers in one match). It is nice to see the friendship blossom even in the midst of cutthroat competition and rivalry and I love most off-match moments as well which have additional character depth moments. The matches themselves are still able to add meaning to quirks rather than have them become irrelevant.\n\nSound and VA 10/10\n\nAmazing sound and OST some of which went instantly to my playlists, so many of the scenes are transformed so well due to the absolute banger of goosebumps and hype-inducing soundtrack accompanied by great voice acting, you would feel like rewatching just those scenes over and over, just like that potato chip scene from death note. Most monologues which are frankly for Animation budget saving are delivered so well that you can be forgiven to take those scenes as great ones even though not much might actually be going on in the screen, THe VA and sound team definitely deserve some awards for this, THe OP and ED are all bangers as well.\n\nArt and Animation 6/10\n\nThe art of Blue lock is great and unique and some scenes which depict the aura of the players are well drawn, the animation however the Achilles heel of this anime and I have already mentioned a lot about it above so lets just leave it at that.\n\nThis is an absolute must-watch for everyone, Though it would be preferable that you treat it as a regular sport-inspired show rather than a football anime, that would let you enjoy it very thoroughly.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SpRayquaza11 (\n108\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

I LOVE IT. The exaggerations of the characters in the show are thrilling. It's about time a sports manga creator tries to do something different. To sum up many peoples complained they just wanted blue lock to be haikyuu but football/soccer. Personally, I find that boring it would've never peaked anyone's interest if it was just haikyuu v2. There are many soccer anime out there already that are like haikyuu but soccer. \n\nWhat I love about Blue Lock is the selflessness of wanting to be the best, the Mamba mentality. The shooting, dribbling, and the\n\n...\n\ncharacter's development during the games are very thrilling also.\n\nWhat I have to say is watch at LEAST watch until episode 6 until you critique it. A lot of things people complain about are literally debunked from watching the show. For instance, people say that the characters have no common sense which is an insult to the characters I guess. When in the first episode ego tells everyone to \"Abandon all common sense\".\n\nIf you don't like the show it's fine it is not for everyone but I recommend it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kazui-_-- (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 12, 2023\n\nAnimeIsWrong\n\nRecommended\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (16/24 eps)\n\n PROS: \n\n+ great animation, OST, direction\n\n+ exciting soccer battle sequences will get you pumped up\n\n+ fast paced, suspenseful, compelling\n\nNEUTRAL:\n\n~ total sausagefest/no waifus\n\nCONS:\n\n- predictable, formulaic plot\n\n...\n\n- literally every character is an expy\n\n- lame, angsty dialogue and melodramatic internal monologues detract from action sequences\n\nRECOMMENDED... with some caveats \n\nBlue Lock, or BL (not to be confused with \"boys love,\" though the show is almost as gay), is not a masterpiece, but it's a fast-paced, punchy watch that will scratch your shonen itch.

But you might be disappointed if you're expecting clever twists, fresh characters or any spice whatsoever because BL is as vanilla as they come.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by AnimeIsWrong (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 30, 2022\n\nSingular9\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (4/24 eps)\n\n I can't give this show more than a 5 for one simple reason. Its a great concept that wastes way too much screen time on useless dialogue. The amount of times I hear the SAME THING repeated over and over, is absurd. Each episode could easily be cut down to a 5-10 minute highlight real and then skip the rest because in these kinds of shows, the dialogue can literally NOT HAPPEN and we will still be entertained. It should be an action anime, not a dialogue heavy shounen. Let the soccer do the talking. I don't need a 5 year old's level play by\n\n...\n\nplay of a single pass, a description of fundamental physics of someone simply KICKING a ball. Instead of using facial expressions, good cut action and so on, we get very mediocre animation with way too much description, which ends up feeling like a waste of time. The general concept/premise of the show is fantastic, but the execution is typical trash.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Singular9 (\n27\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 21, 2022\n\nboi1da\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (7/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock as a concept is a failure. Since this anime has had a lot of hype, I was interested in watching it to see if the anime world has finally adapted a football anime to the same quality as Haikyuu or Kuroko in the sports genre. I was deeply mistaken. The show deviates from football to the idea of \"blue lock\", rather than applying basic football knowledge and conceptualizing a great plot: the show is too busy making it about being the \"best striker.\" I'm an avid football fan; any football person would know by watching the first episode that the show is not\n\n...\n\nactually about football. Sadly, the sport I'm deeply fond of is turned into this mess of a show. I guess the animation is good but animation can't save a horrible plot lol.\n\nIf this is your first time trying to see what football is in the form of an anime, please avoid this.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by boi1da (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 6, 2023\n\nAnnMochii\n\nNot Recommended\nInformative\nWell-written\n\n First and foremost, I would like to delve into the key aspects that Blue Lock brings to the table. Following that matter, it can be argued that the anime has a rather questionable moral compass.\n\nPersonally speaking, I couldn't help but draw comparisons between Blue Lock and Danganronpa. Although there are very obvious similarities in the plot, the show stands apart with its focus on the characters' perspectives. Unlike in Danganronpa, where Monokuma is almost always the common enemy of the group, in Blue Lock, Ego is portrayed as this wise mentor - almost like a deity and the real “enimies” of the players\n\n...\n\nare their own teammates.\n\nWhile the characters in Danganronpa question their own morality, those in Blue Lock seem to relish in dismantling it. The \"Blue Lock experiment,\" rather than being a mere endeavor to create the strongest striker in the world, is a breeding ground for underage psychopaths. The characters, instead of progressing, spiral downwards, trapped in their own bubble. It is important to highlight that, although such a mentality may lead to success in football, became a problem when translated to other areas of life. One can see this phenomenon mirrored in the lives of real-life football players, who often lack moral grounding and are, therefore, not deserving of icon status.\n\nNow, onto the anime itself:\n\nStory: 4/10\n\nUnfortunately, the story falls short and fails to leave a lasting impact. It's just another mediocre shounen that fails to stand out from the rest.\n\nCharacter Evolution: 1/10\n\nThere's not much to say here. The characters don't grow or evolve in any meaningful way. Instead, they become more and more childlike, which doesn't make for a compelling viewing experience. The main character is a classic edgelord who thinks he's better off without friends or a team.\n\nCharacter Design: 7/10\n\nOn the bright side, the character design is impressive. Each character is unique and stands out in their way. However, don't expect to predict what's going to happen based on their appearances. The show throws a few curveballs your way, which is always appreciated.\n\nAnimation: 9/10\n\nThe animation is top-notch and elevates the super-long monologues. The show flows smoothly, except for some of the CGI elements during the matches.\n\nOverall Rating: 5/10\n\nAll in all, while Blue Lock may not be the worst anime out there, it doesn't offer anything groundbreaking. It's a show that can be enjoyed casually, but don't expect to be wowed.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by AnnMochii (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 19, 2023\n\nNaitrodex\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (20/24 eps)\n\n I've seen moderate hype around this anime and was wondering - so I gave it a watch.\n\noh boy I didn’t expect the hellfire I got myself into. However, the most insane thing to me is the score. I truly can’t wrap my head around on why this anime is rated highly. Maybe this is just me going insane, but let me explain my point of view:\n\nThe entire premise is nonsensical. You know what doesn’t go well together? Football and Singleplayer Battle Royale. It has some promising ideas in isolation, but these shouldn’t be mixed. It’s like eating Nutella with KFC. You can do that, but\n\n...\n\nby all means, you shouldn’t.\n\nBut it could still be executed decently - right?\n\nI knew this show was going to be bad the moment the “mastermind” showed himself. This got to be one of the cringiest dudes in anime history. Feel free to watch the first two episodes and tell me that this is not the most cringe, down bad, pseudo-evil character in recent memory. He overstays his welcome so much in fact, that I visually wince every time this guy shows up.\n\nThe plot and story are weak. The main MC and the other \"handsome\" football-boys are unbearable. Noone has a brain, all tropes, all visuals catered towards fanservice; there is literally nothing of any substance. Sound I don't care about, animation is mid to horrific at points, everything around this anime is at maximum a 4 out of 10. How is THIS, as of writing this review, so highly rated. I can't understand. No matter how I look at it, no matter how much I give it the benefit of the doubt, I just can't find a goddamn answer.\n\nOh, and the pure DOPAMINE OF CRINGE I GOT WATCHING THIS... People, FOOTBALL PLAYERS, talk about their inner demon telling them where to shoot and apparently Ronaldo has one aswell... SIUUUUU!\n\nI get it, you do not always want a deep story, people have guilty pleasures, I myself like anime that objectively could be considered \"bad\", but THIS shouldn't be a standard for a good show.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Naitrodex (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 30, 2022\n\nTobirama-Sensei\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (4/24 eps)\n\n Please, let this serve as an example on \"how to kill an anime before it even aired\"... Blue Lock has been fed to us for month as being the greatest football anime we'll ever see, and yes, visually it is, but that's about it.\n\nI don't like to compare anime, but if you take AoAshi : It had simpler animation (to not say \"bad\"), but the character development was pretty high and there were some slice of life included in it so that the whole story wouldn't revolve around football (well, it does, but not entirely).\n\nHere with Blue Lock, we have good animation (not insanely good,\n\n...\n\nbut good enough), but the story is plain and truly not interesting at all. I'm sure the manga did a great job, but the anime.. not so much.\n\nSo yes, the animation is good, but that's about it.. hence my notation.\n\nPS : Next time, don't hype everyone for something half good.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Tobirama-Sensei (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nSnapshot426\n\nRecommended\n\n Blue Lock pretty much came at the right time for me. Coming right after Ao Ashi which I really enjoyed and with the World Cup right around the corner, football fever was indeed very high. And yes, it’s called football, not soccer you goddamn Americans. Blue Lock though was prepared to offer something quite different from your standard sports anime. Something that would go against the typical, “power of teamwork” kind of show; where we test to see how one’s skill and ego can influence the people around you and change the course of any match. This is a show about a boy’s desire to\n\n...\n\nimprove and evolve his game in order to take it to greater heights. This ain’t just your typical sports anime, this is Blue Lock and I’m going to tell you why this show in particular was my favourite show in fall 2022 and subsequently in Winter 2023 and why I believe you should watch it as well. \n\nJust a heads up though, if you are looking for a sports anime that’s more, “traditional”, then this show may not be the show for you. If anything, go watch Ao Ashi. More people need to watch that show anyway. \n\nSo let’s hype our egos, put on our football kit and smash the football into the net as I present to my anime review for Blue Lock. Let’s begin. \n\nStory: 9/10\n\nIsagi Yoichi had failed to win a crucial game that would have taken his team to nationals. While contemplating whether or not he should have taken the shot instead of passing it, he receives a letter from the Japan Football Union, telling him that he, among 299 other “Diamonds in the rough”, have been invited to take part in a program called “Blue Lock” with the promise that whoever completes the program would end up becoming the best striker in the world. Not missing that chance, Isagi joins the Blue Lock program as he aims to come out on top, even if it means crushing the hopes and dreams of the other Blue Lock candidates. \n\nBlue Lock is all focused on how much one’s ego can push them forward in order to achieve victory, to disregard the people around you so only you can focus on how you can do it. Right from the word go, the show makes it very clear that friendship is not something that can help you survive Blue Lock, you and only you can make a difference in order to proceed. That what makes this so interesting because it is the opposite of what is the underlying plot line of any sports anime. Sports anime start off with character being the individual before realising that he/she can rely on their teammates to win. Blue Lock breaks that down and tells you that you should not count on your teammates because if they screw up and you lose, it was out of your hands. It tells you that you must be the one to decide it, you must be the star that your teammates follow to victory. It is made very clear from the first episode when Isagi passed to a teammate instead of taking the shot for himself and they lost because it was out of his hands and it carries that mindset throughout the show. “Don’t be the follower, be the leader. You can use your teammates, but be the one that stands tall in the end.”\n\nIt what makes the battle royale format this show has a great compliment to the egotistical individualism the characters will eventually end up being. I’ve always had a love, hate relationship with BR/death game anime because they always start out interesting but fall off quickly when the usual tropes kick in when the protagonist gets suddenly stronger and more edgy, the dreaded team-up that slows the pace down, etc. Blue Lock isn’t immune to these tropes but I would say it executes them better than other shows. It’s mainly the because of how well Blue Lock’s plot fits the BR style and the plot progresses smoothly along with it as the number of participants starts to get lower, the competition starts to get tougher. As such, the characters’ must adapt and evolve quickly in order to survive. It makes the transition of someone like Isagi’s character from thoughtful teammate to a “devourer” seem appropriate because of what he has to strive for in order to stand on top and use his teammates to stand on top. So it uses the tropes to it’s advantage because it is so ingrained in the plot as to what the show wants to be and what it wants to show. \n\nCharacters: 9.5/10\n\nIsagi’s character arc is one of the highlights of the show for me because, like I said earlier, it is the opposite of a typical sports protagonist. Isagi starts off by relying on his teammates and tries to play it as a team sport, but slowly realises that in order to survive Blue Lock, he has to try and think how he, himself, must be the one to bring victory. Instead of relying on his teammates, he must use them in order to succeed. That’s a crucial point, he doesn’t go hero ball and try to do it alone, but tries to figure out way to use his teammates skillsets to set himself up for victory. What I also like about him is his constant desire to evolve his game; seeing how he can bring victory by “devouring” his opponents. How he must take himself apart and then put back together, represented by puzzle pieces. It gives him something to achieve, something to strive for as he looks for stronger opposition to improve, otherwise he’s just going to stagnate. \n\nIt’s also helped by the supporting cast around being just as fun to watch and Isagi and what helps is that the show isn’t always strictly focused on Isagi and we actually get to know more about some of these other characters as well and what drives them to play football. But what makes it interesting is that each of these characters have their own kind of Ego. Yes they all strive to be the main character but they go about it in different ways. For example, Barou, the king, the lad, the man that has the dog in him has an ego where he is the king of the field and everyone around him are just peons, regardless if they are his teammates or not. Give him the ball and you will win. Whereas you got someone like Nagi, who’s own ego strives from him to join people who will get the best out of him and gets him excited to play football. They all strive for self importance and to be the best on the field but it’s the way they go about it differently that makes them stand out individually, besides their individual skills. \n\nAnimation: 5/10\n\nBlue Lock’s animation is pretty much hard carried by its presentation. The show just nails the intensity of each football match with great angles and just capturing the look on our character’s faces to really sell that these characters are giving their all. The use of colour as well is well used; with it being distinct with each character and is mainly used to capture their fiery passion. That aspect of the animation works to its advantage to hide the fact that this isn’t a well animated show. It relies heavily on still images and sliding panels to capture each scene and while each panel looks good, it doesn’t capture motion well, only really saving it for the most important scenes, mainly when Barou is on screen to steal the budget. It is a shame because we see that this show can be animated well and it does, it just doesn’t do it often enough. That’s why the presentation makes it better than it is because you can capture the look of an intense football match and not worry about how fluid it is. \n\nIt’s also really inconsistent with its use of CG. I’m fine with the football being CG as it works well and I really do like it when it’s used with Isagi putting himself together using puzzle pieces to represent how he is evolving his game. The use of CG there is done really well. Other times it’s used poorly, mainly when we are looking from a bird’s eye view and characters are CG to capture movement and it just sticks out like a sore thumb. \n\nSound: 9.5/10\n\nI usually don’t talk about sound design in reviews because anime tend to use to same sound effects so it just blends into one another. But my god does Blue Lock’s sound design kicks so much ass. The wind of someone running past you, the power of a shot kicking into the back of the net, capturing the moment before the strike, Blue Lock’s sound design really enhances whatever is on screen and it’s how it is used as well. Sometimes the music would stop just so we can hear it before kicking back in. \n\nThat’s not to take away from the soundtrack itself as I really liked this soundtrack. It has a nice blend of dubstep, techno and electronic with some piano in there as well. They are not really genres (besides maybe electronic) that are high among my favourites but the show puts them to really good use and spreads them out well. What sells it I think are the beat drops. That sudden pause isn’t just to let the sound design do its work, it’s also used to drop that hard beat at the climax for that added effect. It also tends to focus on a specific genre when one character is the focus. For example, Barou is usually associated with an electric guitar that goes really hard with it being really heavy to signify that the king is on the prowl and you best not get in his way. \n\nThen there are the openings. The first OP “Chaos ga Kiwamaru” by Unison Square Garden is a very good opening. It is very nicely paced so that the visuals can match the pace of the song and how it times itself when switching scenes with the lyrics. The visuals themselves are well done, seeing the Blue Lock participants fall as Ego grins, knowing he’s got them in the palm of his hands, the puzzle pieces and showcases the more important characters’ weapons. It just gives you a taste to what’s to come and is accompanied by a song that is able to match what is going on what’s on screen. \n\nBut while the show’s first opening is very good, it’s the second opening that absolutely steals the show here. “Judgement” by ASH DA HERO is without a doubt, my favourite OP from this season. First off, that guitar. Second, the colour pallet used here is so good. It makes the whole OP feel so vibrant; especially during the chorus where it looks so damn good. It’s to the point where almost every frame can make a damn good wallpaper. Third, the tone is appropriate for the second cour, as if Isagi is not prepared to lie down and submit. No he’s going in with everything he’s got and with a change of attitude. And Fourth, the song is so damn catchy with the way it uses those instruments to get you pumped. Again, that guitar, but the drums at the end were also very well used. All complimented by that last shot of Isagi grabbing that last puzzle piece with a grin on his face and with a fiery desire to win as it cuts to the title logo. This is such a fun opening to watch and listen to and I really can’t stop listening to it. Again, this is easily my favourite OP of the season, as well as easily being top 3 this season at least. Great, great OP. \n\nAs for the EDs, they’re pretty good. \"WINNER\" by Shuugo Nakamura is a rather standard OP that has a very nice calming song to wind down after the tense action of the episode beforehand. Although, it is a nicely animated OP with some good visuals. Same goes for,\"Numbness like a ginger\" by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN. It is also nicely animated as well although I do like the song more in this one and it’s mainly the instrumentals that made me prefer this over Winner. \n\nConclusion\n\nBlue Lock is an absolutely fantastic time that really offers something different than the usual standard. It’s emphasis on individual actions to improve and win games is different than your typical, win through teamwork, mentality that is the base of a lot of other sports anime. I guess that what makes me gravitate towards it more than other sports anime because I can watch any of these popular sports anime and see the base groundwork for the rest of the show to follow. Blue Lock flips that groundwork on its head to be more unique while still doing some things that feel similar. \n\nThrough an intense and engaging storyline, well developed characters, very good presentation, excellent sound design and OST, as well as probably having the best OP of the Winter season, Blue Lock offers a very enjoyable experience that has made it my favourite show to watch for the past two seasons now. But again, this isn’t for someone who is looking for a traditional sports anime, this is for someone who is looking for something different than the norm although you can still like this if you are looking for something more traditional. It’s just so fun and gripping to watch to see a main character develop in the opposite route to become the main man, rather than just a cog in the machine. It is a show that I highly recommend as one of the best anime of the past few seasons and I can’t wait to see what’s going to happen next. \n\nMy Personal Enjoyment: 10/10\n\nOverall Score: Recommendation: 8.6/10 Recommendation: Go F**king Watch It\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Snapshot426 (\n86\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 23, 2022\n\nKvgehira\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (3/24 eps)\n\n The anime & manga is a mixture of hunger games and soccer: A survivor game between teenagers between 16-18. If you lose the game you are eliminated and your career is over forever. That sounds extremely scary for the 300 players who are passionate about football. The only one standing becomes the best striker in japan, and maybe in the whole world! The anime is extremely well constructed. It keeps the suspense up to the end, especially the first episode doesn't leave you with enough and you always want to know more. The voice actors do a very good job and you can really feel the emotions\n\n...\n\nthrough their voice. Also, the animation is clean and looks smooth! There´s nothing I can complain about since I really enjoyed it. Of course teamwork is very important in football but some seem to miss the plot. Blue Lock is looking for a striker who is that good and can even compete with Ronaldo. I've been playing football in school teams since I was in elementary school. So I can say: Why are you complaining? Everyone on the team has a different task. Strikers have to score the goal, be quick. They bring success and are responsible for the goals and without goals no team can win. This is the most important task. You can't expect the striker to play with the defender. They will play teamwork yeah..if they are playing real football. Everyone plays their own role until teamwork is required. Funny how non-football players are complaining the most.\n\nHowever, I also think that Yoichi is a very good protagonist. Although he has a cool personality, he still has a bit of a 'blank canvas' as well, he's not 'over-described' yet, which makes him a very good identification figure for the watcher. Jingo or a Meguru, who stand out because of the stubbornness of their personalities, that wouldn't be so possible. Yoichi's character leaves more room for development and potential in all conceivable directions.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kvgehira (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nSiriusStarlight\n\nRecommended\n\n I know people who are really into sports and I can confirm they are exactly like this.\n\nBlue Lock manages to be absolutely overflow with charm by sheer virtue of being as over-the-top and deranged as humanly possible. Every single episode you'll hear a teenager talk about their pride in their skills or resolve to be the best Soccer player they can be through saying it in the most unhinged ways imaginable, accompanied by an extreme visualization of that exact phrasing. Even if the amount of depth a character has can vary in how deep or shallow they are, everyone manages to be really memorable in\n\n...\n\ntheir own distinct brand of insanity that contributes to the constant high-energy feel of thhow. A big contributing factor to that is its stellar voice cast. Pretty much everyone here brings their absolute A-game into their roles with a powerful intensity that's unique to each and every one of them. My particular favorites were Kazuki Ura as Isagi and Tatsuku Kaito as Bachira, which is especially impressive given that they're pretty much entirely new faces in voice acting. I'm really happy that these leading roles were given to such promising newcomers, and I really hope that their phenomenal performances lead to really bright futures in their careers.\n\n Another one of the core pillars that makes Blue Lock what it is are its visuals. However, I should address the fact that its animation is an area where it stumbles a bit. It feels a bit apparent that it wasn't given as much of a large budget as it could have, or if it ran into issues in production, but it does have a noticeable impact on its animation. It often relies on stills or really rough-looking CG models in a lot of areas in a way that's pretty off-putting to see when those cracks show. That being said, its animation often being a tad inconsistent is more than made up for with its fantastic direction. Its use of incredibly intense expressions and shading that feels reminiscent of Attack on Titan at times, effective use of distinct imagery like the puzzle pieces connecting to and breaking off of Isagi or the \"monster\" that resides around Bachira, and incredibly strong storyboarding that makes its big headlining shots land with the same impact as a spread from a manga page give it a striking sense of style that feels very unique to it. And make no mistake with my earlier complaints about its animation, when they need to sell an impactful moment, it shines really brightly. I just hope these production issues get ironed out by the time season 2 comes around, so both the animation and direction get to work in harmony and shine ever brighter.\n\nThe thing I found most compelling about Blue Lock story-wise is the nuance of Blue Lock's goals as a facility and the type of player it's trying to be. I've seen a good amount of criticism towards the series' supposed notion that a striker is the only player that matters in a soccer team. That's obviously entirely true, but I think that angle is looking into the whole \"making the best striker\" aspect of it a bit too literally. The way I see it, Ego sees the problem with the Japan team being that their focus solely on fighting as one made it so that the players' individual strengths suffered as a result, so the goal for Blue Lock is to refine the selected players as individuals and bring out their latent strengths. It's an approach that encourages the players to have somewhat selfish and egotistical mindsets in how they evolve, which doesn't sound like it'd work all too well. However, the show ironically makes it so that this drive ends up strengthening their teamwork. It invites a spirit of competition between its team members where they manage to work in harmony by spiritually devouring each other (the show's words, not mine) in order to make major bursts of improvement, and those clashes of wills end up letting the players work in harmony very well. It's a very unique angle to take a sports series in storytelling wise, one that I haven't really seen before at least. I imagine that it's definitely really unrealistic and over-the-top, but the series fully embraces that aspect of itself.\n\nWatching this show week to week was one of the most fun experiences I've had keeping up with a seasonal, and I'm glad I got to experience it so often through the phenomenal stretch of Fall 2022 and the admittedly less enticing stretch of Winter 2023. I'm fully hooked on checking out the utterly insane clash of wills through soccer that Blue Lock has in store for the future, and I'm looking forward to its eventual return with Season 2 and the Episode Nagi film.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SiriusStarlight (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nRazor_Eagle11\n\nRecommended\n\n Blue Lock is a refreshing take on the anime sports genre. There's no 'all for one and one for all' kind of sportsmanship here, they're playing based on their egos and they are not afraid to talk shit to each other. watching the first episode will definitely make you hooked. However, there are a few things that I want to point out about Blue Lock starting with the Pros.\n\nThe pros:\n\nThe story starts of simple, the MC Isagi Yoichi got invited to join the Blue Lock project as a candidate to be the best striker in the world. The premise and how the story goes plays\n\n...\n\nsimilarly to a battle-shounen type of anime, with the power system being the Blue Lock rankings and the \"weapons\" that they use being a soccer skill. Every match feels intense as if you're watching a real soccer match. The characters are fairly interesting and have different motivations and backgrounds that made them stand out. The openings and endings are a banger, really makes you not want to skip it. The voice acting is great, and there's a lot of veteran voice actor in the anime\n\nand now let's talk about the cons.\n\nThe cons:\n\nThe first episode has really good animation but as the time goes the animation gets less detailed and less fluid. The use of CGI is more apparent especially on the 2nd cour, and there's a lot of still shots and weird use of effects that makes it more jarring to watch. I don't get why the change Isagi's blue aura in the earlier episodes to green, which is a weird color choice for me. Certain important moments became less impactful because of the less detailed animation. When you draw a comparison between the manga and the anime, the manga easily takes the cake. \n\nOverall Blue Lock is a good adaptation, although the animation may not be the best, I say they adapted the the manga pretty well. I just hope they adapt the Blue Lock vs U-20 Japan with better animation because it's one of the best arcs in the manga.\n\nThanks for reading\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Razor_Eagle11 (\n22\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nAragane\n\nRecommended\n\n \"Blue Lock,\" a manga adaptation that's all about soccer. But not the kind of soccer you see in your backyard. No, no, no, this is soccer on steroids! It's a story about teenage boys who want to become the best soccer player in Japan. And they're not just happy with being good. Oh no, they want to be the BEST, better than anyone else.\n\nThe story follows a guy named Isagi Yoichi. This dude got some serious talent when it comes to soccer. But he's not happy with being good. He wants to be the best. And he'll do whatever it takes to get there. That's\n\n...\n\nwhere the Blue Lock program comes in. It's a special training camp designed to turn good soccer players into great ones, and Yoichi is one of the lucky few who get selected.\n\nBut here's the catch, kids. The Blue Lock program is not your ordinary soccer camp. It's more like a battle royale, where the players are pitted against each other in intense matches to see who's \"the best\" of the best. And these guys are not playing nice, oh no, they're playing dirty. They're using every trick in the book to beat each other, and it's all for the sake of becoming the best soccer player in Japan.\n\nNow, I know what you're thinking, \"this sounds like a violent show!\" But don't worry, there's no blood or gore here. It's all the good old-fashioned soccer action. Only with some intense rivalry that is thrown in for good measure. And the best part? The story is frankly a good twist of the sports genre. Because it got a unique premise that's not been seen before in sports manga, and the characters are all well-developed and interesting. \n\nSpeaking a bit about how 8bit studio decided to animate this adaptation, the usage of CGI during the matches in \"Blue Lock\" might put off many viewers, especially the traditional animation puritans. While the CGI of this show isn't the best in the industry, it does get the job done. It's understandable why the producers decided to use CGI, as it allows them to depict the fast-paced movements and actions of the sport more realistically. However, some viewers might find it jarring to switch from traditional animation to CGI during the match scenes. \n\nAlthough, when the time calls for it, the best scenes are animated well. When \"Blue Lock\" uses traditional animation, it can be stunning. The character designs are unique and memorable, perhaps too unique for sports. The action scenes are particularly well-animated, with dynamic camera angles and impressive use of color and lighting. \n\nThe opening and ending songs in \"Blue Lock\" are good, but nothing more. While they do a decent job setting the show's tone, they aren't particularly memorable or catchy. However, some of the OSTs used throughout are nicely complementing the scenarios. They help to build tension during intense scenes and create a sense of nostalgia during quieter moments. \n\nThe voice actors in \"Blue Lock\" are all respectably passionate about filling the shoes of those strikers. Each character has a distinct voice and personality, and the voice actors do an excellent job of bringing them to life. Whether it's the confident and ambitious protagonist Yoichi, or the passive-aggressive Ego Jinpachi, each character's voice is spot on and adds to the overall enjoyment of the series.\n\nEven if \"Blue Lock\" is not up to the palate of some viewers, it's staying power is there. If memes have proven anything, there are moments in this show that can even be taken out of context as a memorable gifs. Some scenes in the show are just so over-the-top and ridiculous that they become instantly meme-able. This staying power can keep this show in the public consciousness long after it has finished airing. Which is always a good thing for any series. \n\nSo, in conclusion, \"Blue Lock\" is a great manga that's perfect for anyone who loves soccer or sports manga in general. It's got great action, interesting characters, and a unique story. That's sure to keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Aragane (\n47\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 28, 2024\n\n200px\n\nRecommended\n\n The anime managed to surprise me.

First and foremost, the idea that a \"striker\" is the most important player on the field is a HUGE assumption that could be discussed in numerous ways, but I'll just mention the fact that goalkeeper seems to be ignored as a prime reason this show is already junk. Want to check basically any league? You'll find the teams with best keepers are the most winning. But, ok let's ignore that. WTF is a striker in modern soccer? Traditionally its a mid-foreward when you run an archaic offense that wouldn't win anything in modern\n\n...\n\nsoccer (the premise of bluelock from the getgo). Soccer is a TEAM sport! Messi plays center mid, center forward, wing forward. Ronaldo plays mostly wing forward, center forward, and even center full-back in counterstrike. The entire concept of running an offense through a \"striker\" as opposed to \"a system based on the talent of the players you have\" is so far from modernization that it makes the concept of the show embarrassing. Also, let's get real, real. No amount of fancy anime magic is going to make you 4 inches taller, 20 lbs heavier, 1 second quicker, 3mph faster, or 2x stronger. Good sports animes address these realities. Terrible ones make up BS to act like \"my special absorb skill, or hawk eye view\" can make up for all of my other deficiencies. NO! THEY CANNOT! If you are looking for a fantasy where you think I could have been a pro soccer player-despite being small, weak, slow, untalented- then yes, this is for you! But, if you like sports anime that shows real sports and players with talents and limitations... well... not gonna be found here.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by tmunee (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 13, 2022\n\nJustCallMeZeus\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (5/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock is mediocre at best. The exaggerated compliments from fans cannot be trusted. I can say the same (midiocre) with both the anime and the manga, cuz the anime has been true to it's source so far. \n\nBlue Lock is quite enjoyable to watch because of its animation and art, I think that's what people are crazy about... But aside from animation and art, Blue Lock can't really offer anything good when it comes to the story and the characters. \n\nIt's plot is almost non-existent. It's premise, \"selecting the greatest striker in the world out of 300 applicants\" is kind of childish and just\n\n...\n\ndownright ridiculous. The writing of this series is bad and shallow, almost like written by a drop out kid from high school who's on high from using drgs. The characters are also written badly and lacks a lot in terms of personality and brain, they are one dimensional and overpowered. I wish the author focus more on fixing the writing of the main characters and the story rather than nonstop addition of characters with the same personality. \n\nThe facial expressions are over the top and exaggerated most of the time, and the dialogues are really bad I'm not gonna lie, there's no speck of intelligence nor elegance in it but atleast it has dialogues(?) it's really corny and childish for me despite it trying so hard to be edgy. Their whole vocabulary revolves around random made up quotes in life, death and survival quotes, ego centric quotes that sometimes doesn't make sense, etc...It's still watchable though, it can make your brain go dull to the point where you're just gonna laugh it all out, shake the second hand embarrassment and move on like what blue lock fans do. \n\nIt's kind of gayish too, which i think contributed to it's popularity. \n\nSo yeah. \n\nIt's mid overall. This anime just feel empty, idk I can't describe it exactly but there was no pull or attachment after you watch it or read it... nothing strikes to my body organs, I was poker faced the whole time. It's like im only watching this anime for the hype at this point.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by JustCallMeZeus (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 6, 2023\n\nchips901\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Okay, Blue Lock.\n\nEven though nobody cares about default L opinions, I'm doing myself a favour by typing out my harsh rating here instead of filling out the comment section of the anilist entry. It'd look better anyways.\n\nLooking at Blue Lock holistically, it's a very well-done adaptation. It faithfully follows the beats of the manga, focusing the drawings on high-points and extensively using 3d during its low-points. It's definitely worth noting that this is the most impressive implementation of 3D I've seen thus far.\n\nBut the quality of the production... still feels rather cheap and underwhelming. The drawings are well done but aren't dynamic and lack fluidity.\n\n...\n\nThe effects (in particular, some of the character glows) are even cheaper and you can even see the pixilation in them. And the extensive use of 3D to make up for the lack of moving 2D parts clearly expose the limitations of what the 2-slide-long-powerpoint team could achieve.\n\nSo the limitations become the question then. Do you accept a faithful adaptation for a trade of explicit quality?\n\nMy answer is no, because having read the manga... my mind will always flock to the manga and none of the moments from the anime. And ultimately, I don't settle for less.\n\nThis isn't to disrespect the production team. This is the best lowly B-tier anime that I've seen and sets the bar quite high... in its own weight class.\n\nI can only imagine two scenarios that can explain the quality of this show.\n\n1. The shareholders didn't believe that Blue Lock would take off. Hence, smaller team, lower budget, lower risk.\n\n2. The small team with small budget really wanted to work on Blue Lock, so they went out of their way to secure the contract and le bags.\n\nThe thing about this consoomerist era is that very, *very*, VERY high quality stuff is presented to you without any action from the consoomer. It's very cutthroat. Trends move extremely fast and things are so easily forgettable in favour of the next flavour of the month limited edition cute anime twink butt plug.\n\nTherefore, if scenario 1 was true, then the shareholders are to blame for gimping the overall quality of the anime. Case closed. If scenario 2 was true... I would congratulate the team on their success and hope they can expand in the future.\n\nWhy would you settle for less in an era where you can always ask for more? There isn't anything wrong with asking for more. You are the target and you can always ask for more. Settling for less... That's a bit weird in an era where past anime can easily outrun the small game anytime, anywhere.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\nMy recommendation is simple. Completely ignore the anime and read the manga instead. If you can envision a better looking Blue Lock anime that's more dynamic and fluid than the show itself... the anime will feel completely underwhelming in every single regard.\n\nTo me, Blue Lock feels like one of the best B-tier anime. Under the hood, it clearly showcases the importance of raw manpower as it defines the limitations of your work. So, if Blue Lock defines the upper limits of a B-tier anime...\n\n... Then the upper limits themselves continue to be quite the disappointment. 3/10.\n\nUntil next time.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by chips901 (\n20\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 9, 2023\n\nRealanimelover01\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (17/24 eps)\n\n First of all,\n\nThe people saying this isn't a good anime by any standards and deeming it unworthy of being recommended , i would love to know what according to you ''Anime lovers'' defines a good anime?\n\nIf it's a good plot (a strong one at that) , loveable characters , good character development , amazing animation , good pacing and you still don't like but (let me say it) HATE blue lock , there's something wrong with your taste.\n\nFrom the moment Isagi and his team lost the match in episode 1 , I was hooked , completely . And then the ending (OMG!) , it was\n\n...\n\nnothing short of iconic and set the standard of what the anime has to offer.\n\nIt was a decent if not a spectacular ending to a pilot episode. After that episode , there had been so many matches , all of them being intense . And when I say intense , I mean it . The characters are literally trying their best to win , to advance , to fulfil their lifelong dream , to make the ones they love happy and lastly to be happy themselves and have fun playing soccer . \n\nThe character development is amazing . Every once in a while , you get to see a character's backstory , be it a minor one or a major one.\n\nYou get to know each and every character's reason of playing soccer , how it makes them feel completely , allows them to have fun and the source of all their passion. Their passion is seen throughout , by how hard they try to evolve constantly to become better . hone their skills . and are not afraid to match with stronger opponents. The characters connect with their teammates , though it takes time . \n\nThe pacing is superb . From the 1st episode , the anime has been interesting and soo addicting . After a episodes ends , it's literally impossible to wait a whole other week . That's just how addictive it's. Not a single moment has been boring so far , because this anime literally progresses at breakneck speed. \n\nThe animation is amazing and especially those shots where you see the characters' demonic version , mad to win and crush their opponents. Their eyes literally demonic and the haunting music that accompanies , it just drowns you into the scene and you feel the energy the characters are feeling seeping through you too. \n\nDuring a match , many a times situations get grim. Isagi's team is on the brink of losing and the situation gets so intense when the characters start breaking down......and then they EVOLVE.\n\nYou also see the losing team's members reactions after losing a match . Their dream shattered of ever being to able to play soccer again , and their hauntingly devastated expressions keep reminding you of the grim fate that players will face if they lose.\n\nOverall , I love this anime very much . Its a straight 10 . Would recommend to everyone.\n\nAnd people who don't like it , doesn't matter , cuz you're all in the minority , so there.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Realanimelover01 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 22, 2025\n\nfarcillieftw\n\nMixed Feelings\nFunny\n\n I must let it be known: I have NO respect for this show AT ALL lmfao and my rating is solely for the absolutely delicious yaoi content.

Every episode, every scene, and every shot looks exactly the same. The same color palette, the same backgrounds, and the same lighting. Bland blues and grays are the only colors\n\n...\n\nthat exist in the blue lock universe, so get ready to see a lot of that. The art direction is bad enough, but the animation isn't much better. I'm serious when I say this- this show has the worst CGI usage I have ever seen in my life. Every time they play soccer (which is often, as you can imagine), almost every character not directly in focus is a mobile game quality 3d model walking across the pitch. I don't know how much time, money, or effort was spent on each episode, but they need more of all of those things.\n\nThe characters are so unbelievably uninteresting. They all have decent enough designs, but each one's only actual character trait is that they wan to be 'the world's greatest striker!', and then they'll throw something like \"he's lazy,\" \"he's an asshole\", or \"he's smart\" on top of that. When every character has the exact same ambitions, they all feel one dimensional. That isn't helped by the fact that we know nothing about any of them outside of their soccer careers. What do they like to do for fun? Who knows. What are their families like? Who cares. What are their school lives like? No idea. At this point in the show, literally every character on the main team, including the MC, are critically underdeveloped. They need to stop cramming as much action as possible into each episode, and start dedicating a large amount of time to expanding on these characters ASAP, or this show will be beyond saving. That might be an impossible task though, when all of the writing sounds like something I would come up with after watching a sword art online episode when I was 12. All of the 'cool' lines are something like \"I have monster inside of me that wants to eat you all >:)\", or \"You have to let the demon out to score goals!\". As you can probably expect, the way the characters talk and interact with each other, is also not good. Even if the characters were developed, it would still be hard to make the watcher care about them with that being the case. \n\nI don't really know what people see in this show . Despite the massively flawed anime, the popularity has absolutely exploded- hell, Japan is wearing blue lock themed jerseys at the WORLD CUP! The biggest sports event in the history of the world! How did the author manage to pull that off???\n\nAnyways, I'll keep watching until the end of the show, but my optimism for the next 15 episodes is pretty low.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by slimysteak (\n45\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 18, 2024\n\nGwynbleidd_Alan\n\nRecommended\n\n Honestly, Blue Lock surprised me. I haven't seen many sports anime, because it's very different from what I usually enjoy, so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but I ended up liking it. The plot has a good balance between being based in realism and including made up elements and players, which made it both fun and surprisingly believable. They even throw in real-life events, like Germany winning the World Cup, and casually mention stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. It gives the whole thing a cool sense of realism while still being its own story.\n\nThe plot is solid for what it sets out\n\n...\n\nto do. Japan is on the hunt for its next star striker to lead them to a World Cup victory. They gather 300 talented young strikers at a special facility, where they compete in different tournaments and matches to find the absolute best of the best. It has solid antagonists, protagonists and plot twist which keep the story interesting though it's obviously a bit limited on how far it can go (considering it's an anime about sports). \n\nI personally really dislike CGI in anime if it's badly done and Blue Lock suffers a lot from having way too much bad CGI. They use CGI in basically every episode and it looks comically bad. People run across around the field looking like an NPC from a PS2 game and their model looks lifeless which is a shame. I understand that animating some of the scenes was probably hard but opting for CGI was the wrong choice, in my humble opinion. It breaks immersion and negatively impacted my experience of watching. \n\nI really enjoyed watching it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys football. The way they weave in real events and players adds a nice touch of realism. It’s rare to see an anime balance real life and fiction so effectively, but this one does it surprisingly well. I suppose some people might not feel as annoyed or disturbed by the CGI, but I guess that varies from person to person. I can only speak from myself and say that I found it so bad at times that I couldn't help but laugh. A charming and entertaining story nevertheless all around, which was better than I thought it would be.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Gwynbleidd_Alan (\n27\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nPrevious\n - \nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

What I mean by that is that if you are here to see depictions of football matches in anime, whether it is realistic or not, you won't find it here. It's probably the main reason why some of the top reviews didn't like the anime, but it should have been obvious from the premise.\n\nThe anime is about strikers. Obviously, the position of striker will be considered more important than\n\n...\n\nother positions in the anime, even if you think football in real life is different. I would even say the reasoning explained in the anime is pretty convincing: Japanese people tend to prioritize the team before themselves and don't deal well with unexpected situations because everything is well organized. I have no idea if this is true for the actual Japanese team and I don't know much about football, but the situation in the anime is clear: Japan is missing a striker and this Blue Lock Project is here to create one.\n\nAnother interesting part in this anime is that it doesn't follow the usual setting where the main characters are a school club trying to win the national tournament.\n\nNow the negatives, because the anime isn't perfect. The characters are rather shallow, and you'll only learn more about a handful so if you're here for character development it's probably not for you. The anime also often focuses on a single character so the field view is often narrow even during the plays. There are also a lot of monologues during the actions which can be annoying. The animation is pretty good, although the few bird's-eye views that are used are pretty bad.\n\nOverall I really recommend the anime whether you're a football fan or not, 9/10.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by math20082 (\n16\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 26, 2023\n\nPixelB\n\nRecommended\n\n Blue Lock's a show about pitting the 300 best Japanese high school level strikers together in a Kodoku of sorts--forcing them to clash and compete against each other--to find out Japan's best forward player. \n\n\"That just sounds like a survival/death game show with extra steps.\" This statement isn't wrong. Blue Lock is a show that combines the typical shounen sports/battle show and distills each genre by combining the best attributes of both aspects and shedding off the weaknesses that typically come packaged with the genres.\n\nFirst off is the death game aspect itself. It's not that edgy. It's within the bounds of shounen reasoning, and it\n\n...\n\nsoftens the cringe and fast-paced nature of death game shows to begin with. The premise of the show doesn't revolve around survival: it's about becoming the best soccer player. When a player gets kicked out of Blue Lock, they're not going to die or anything, they just are out of the competition. There remains the threat of never being able to represent Japan as a soccer player, and that threat is very real, but it's not a literal battle to the death. There's no battle shock, guilt, or depression that comes with winning over your opponent while also still maintaining the high-stakes aspects that we all know and love from survival death games. \n\nNext is skill expression. A lot of these death game shows, like Kami-sama no Iu toori, Deatte Go-by≈ç de Batoru, and Darwin's Game tend to rely heavily on luck. Each game that these shows go through is unrelated to the last, and there tends to be a lot more of a luck factor and also a psychological one. There are a lot of psychological mind games--which I love--but at the same time, the games are quite arbitrary. One game might suit one person's skillset but not the other. In Blue Lock, luck is mitigated to an extreme degree. It's a continuous competition in determining the best soccer player, so the only thing that gets tested is their soccer skills, whether it be dribbling, ball control, scoring, or stamina, your soccer skill is the only thing that matters. Even if your team sucks in Blue Lock, if you distinguish yourself as the best scorer, you will pass regardless. It's a lot more skill-based than the death game genre, where you're influenced highly by the type of game being played and your temporary teammates which can spell the end of you.\n\nComing off the shounen sports side of the coin, this show has strong characters. This show has a great premise for setting up plays: everyone is a damn striker. Everyone is the main character. They're all OP. By nature, there's no supporting cast. If you cannot score, you will get \"Locked off.\" As such, every character has a main character-type personality and is overbearing, and there are always going to be insane battles of these main-character-type strikers battling it out against each other for victory. You also get to see these characters naturally forming in teams, forging friendships, and having chemistry with each other. Each character will never always be with the same types of players due to the selection forcing everyone to pick different teammates, so you constantly see combinations and synergies. It's still a team game, so characters also interact with each other more, and you get to explore their personalities and playstyles as a result.\n\nWith the premise being that each character is a striker also comes the fun premise of battling it out. Characters work together in different scenarios, and they all clash for supremacy. Every striker has their own \"winning formula\" and they all try to perfect it by honing it against other equally amazing strikers. In each match, you will see players evolving at a rapid pace because, well, everyone is a main character. It doesn't surprise me that everyone learns at a prodigious pace because that's the whole point: everyone selected is a genius, and these battles revolve around them. Players develop new strategies, find new ways to score more effectively, and find synergies to break through defenses.\n\nThis comes to the detail-oriented and strategic part of the show. While you would expect a show about only strikers and no other positions to be brain-dead battle shounen like Kuroko no Basket, surprisingly, this show pays attention to tactics as much as it pays attention to the one on one ball skills. There's tremendous focus on the positioning of players and drilling down to the strategy of utilizing each player's weaknesses and strengths to each team's advantage. There's the use of triangle formations, targeting the weak link, and having a strategy to counter the enemy team's strengths. Of course, since this is still ultimately a show about strikers and one on ones, there's a lot of monologuing about each player's thought process and their subsequent evolutions in their play mid-match. There's going to be a lot of \"going into the zone,\" mental breakdowns and recoveries, and intense showdowns between each player. The show keeps the exciting tempo of strikers learning new things and playing better while also keeping a sufficient amount of time on strategy.\n\nThe production value of the show is also great compared to other sports shows. Yes, there is use of CGI, but it's only in far shots. All of the close up angles are hand animated, and they look great. The shading, the lines, and the details of the plays shine through. While there are still shots used, the art still looks good. It's one of the few shows in the 20th century that have a high production value soccer animation that actually shows the situation on the field while also showcasing choreographed movement.\n\nWhile this show is still shallow in many aspects, let me ask you this: do other shows fare better? Yes, the weakness in only having strikers and main characters with no mainstay team is obvious. There's a lack of characterization compared to a show like Big Windup. There are too many characters in Blue Lock, and lacking a static team means there's not enough time or reason to pursue digging too deep into player relations. At the same time though, Big Windup suffers the same mistakes. While yes, I can think of 6 or so characters in Nishiura High's baseball team, I can't remember all of them or how unmemorable some of the characters are sometimes. There's still a massive and unbalanced focus on the main characters: Abe, Mihashi, Tajima, and Hanai. The rest are supporting the cast and are much less relevant. And that's when Big Windup is all about the 9-player baseball team and their journey towards Koushien! The series is slow-paced, and you get to understand each player's personality, but it still suffers from the fact that the supporting cast still doesn't have much characterization.\n\nWhat about the strategy? Honestly, for something like Ao Ashi or Giant Killing, which are about becoming professional, playing with a balanced team of 11 soccer players in their respective positions, Blue Lock pays a lot more attention to detail. Ao Ashi spends much less time in player showdowns while also not drilling too deep into strategies. Same thing with Giant Killing, an anime that supposedly is about an actual Pro club with an amazing coach as a main character. There are a lot more games in Ao Ashi and Giant Killing, and as a result, there's a lot less detail in the matches. In Blue Lock, each player's position is accounted for and each match is laced with tension. Ao Ashi talks about the same strategies that Blue Lock focuses on triangular formations, and specific strategies to take down their opponent, yet Blue Lock not only shows the positioning much more clearly in many plays but also brings in the one on one elements and monologuing that Ao Ashi could never provide. Plus, Ao Ashi similarly has too many characters with a lack of characterization, especially in the romance.\n\nWhat about battle shounens like Kuroko no Basket? I love Kuroku no Basket, but the stuff in that show is supernatural. It's not grounded in reality. There are not a lot of strategies, and it truly is just a one-on-one showdown between two characters. This is fun, but Blue Lock, despite how unrealistically OP everyone is at learning and being so good, still utilizes realistic strategies and mechanics used in real-life soccer while also maintaining that fun one on one action.\n\nOverall, Blue Lock shores up on a lot of weaknesses, but despite all the praise I give it, there are still a lot of flaws. Still, the overwhelming amount of characters truly means that there's lacking characterization no matter how much monologuing or action you give them. The show tries to cover this up with a mandatory flashback arc for each main character, but it's just stale and repetitive at some point. It reminded me of Demon Slayer vibes, where each demon HAD to have a shitty sob story or something that I had to sit through. The difference in Blue Lock, however, is that the flashbacks are incredibly short, only a few minutes at most, with a lack of emphasis as well as intentionally leaving out details in the flashback. This way, it doesn't kill the pacing or the action that is currently happening.\n\nPlus, the main character is super generic still and doesn't make too much sense as a consistent character. First off is how his \"famed ability\" is a playmaking ability, just like Ashito in Ao Ashi. Not very original. He even possesses a mediocre physique, just like Ashito, They're almost mirrors in the skills they possess. What about personality? Well, Isagi is typically a polite Japanese protagonist, but in-game, he transforms into an unfeeling demon. It's like he has a split-personality disorder, or he's a psychopath. He's usually sympathetic, but when he plays soccer, he only feels the thrill of crushing other peoples' dreams. What the hell? This never even gets addressed. While I get that playing soccer will make a player aggressive and do what they need to do to win, Isagi just feels like he's a completely different character. Other characters similarly become much more aggressive, hot-headed, and passionate, but their personalities match their in-game ones. Barou acts like a king on the field, and that arrogance stays with him off the field. Nagi's an eccentric genius on the field, and also off as well. Bachira talks about his monster on the field, and also off as well. Each of the other characters has consistent states of mind and personalities, but not Isagi. To put it simply, he's a crappy main character with not much consistency. On one hand, he's constantly reminding himself that he's a supposed \"mob character,\" yet his results beg to differ. He's as OP as any other character is.\n\nThis show, however, still manages to deliver a fun, yet not completely edgy and mindless sports show that has survival-game elements.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by PixelB (\n454\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 26, 2023\n\nMAKandCHIZZ\n\nRecommended\n\n Blue lock is great!\n\nI think you can trust me when I use \"great\" for a sports anime. After seeing 24 episodes of this season, I want to say that it was a superb anime with very good animation and voice acting. After 11 episodes, I read the manga alongside watching the anime and I would say it was a perfect adaptation and, of course, there were some moments in the manga that we liked so much more, details and everything, but in overall I think it would be fair to say it was a good adaptation from the manga series.(but I think it would be\n\n...\n\ngood to read the manga alongside with anime it worth it!)\n\nI loved the animation and art style of blue lock though it can be designed with more details sometimes, but making an episode for every week is pretty hard I think, and in my opinion it was very good in the animation part.\n\nI like the voice acting in general, and they really do some good work in this part.\n\nAnd about the story, I think it's very interesting that every character has its own power and there is a lot of people with different powers to team up and fight with each other to pass the stages of blue luck, and I think this anime made people to follow and see the glow up of each character in different stages to fight for their own dream to become world best striker. \n\nI totally recommend this anime to anyone that love football or sports anime and even anyone who love anime!\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MAKandCHIZZ (\n14\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 4, 2023\n\nMeebee\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n If you're looking for a sports anime like Haikyuu or Free or anything remotely realistic, this isn't it chief. Yes, it's about soccer, but everything you expect it to be about (comradery, teamwork, having fun...) isn't what Blue Lock is about. This makes Blue Lock refreshing in a way, but it's also why I'm putting this review as mixed instead of recommended - not everyone is going to like this subversion, and that's completely fair.\n\nI myself, however, enjoyed Blue Lock - somehow it made me come back each week to see what the boys were up to. Yes, it's cheesy and some of the dialogue\n\n...\n\nborders on cringy, but it was interesting to see what the hell they were going to come up with next to make our main protagonist seem like a genius. The animation is also great for the most part (I'm not talking about the less than stellar 3D, which they really don't use sparingly in matches), although I found the setting of this \"Blue Lock\" project to be lacking.\n\nOverall Blue Lock is enjoyable for some, and a complete bore- or cringefest for others - I can see it go both ways. I'd say, if you aren't completely turned off by the idea of it not being your typical sports anime, give it a shot!\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Meebee (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 21, 2023\n\nMarin-Chan\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (23/24 eps)\n\n I don‚Äôt even like football much but this anime is so good, i‚Äôm even reading the manga now!.

I feel like the exhilarating part of this show should be watching and ACTUALLY WITNESSING how the game goes down, but instead, you end up being heavily reliant on the character's dialogue or thoughts to know what's happening. And for a soccer noob like me who\n\n...\n\nis not well-versed in the world of soccer, it's just more difficult without fluid visuals. \n\nUsually in shounen anime I can overlook the unrealistic aspects for entertainment, but somehow I can't for Blue Lock. The progression/pacing of the \"evolutions\" and awakenings and just improvements of Isagi and all the characters in general are absolutely ridiculous. It's just one dude after another. Like bro, if I were to be in the world of Blue Lock, I could've cured cancer with their default system settings. Just confine me in a several-month container lab and bam. I'll do wonders. That being said, I couldn't really relate to any of the characters. \n\nOverall, Blue Lock is definitely an entertaining shitshow (a chaotic mess) to watch, but if you've watched Haikyuu and are looking for another sports anime to live up to the same expectation, you might find yourself to be disappointed.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by saltyoceanside (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nPhidoe\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Mixed feelings describe Blue Lock pretty good. \n\nIt reaches greats heights while traveling through the deepest valleys shortly after. \n\nThe idea behind Blue Lock is absolutely great. This whole academy setting paired with battle royal elements is almost guaranteed for some pretty intense and emotional moments. The animation is good, in my opinion. All you would need in order to make this work would be only one thing. \n\nWell written and interesting characters. \n\nAnd this where this show lacks the most. After all 24 episodes I couldn't care less for any of the remaining characters. The show didn't manage to give me any reason why\n\n...\n\nI should root for them to succeed. Especially the protagonist feels like he is just an empty shell. Ok, they all want to be the best. But what else ? I didn't expect much but come on. \n\n I admit, that it's difficult to make all characters interesting when you have to manage this huge amount of characters. Some characters get a short backstory but they were just short views in their life before Blue Lock and didn't provide much information. We have a lot of cliche characters but again with such a huge cast it is understandable to rely on some stereotypes.\n\nThe story is ok for the genre. I mean, if you have seen some sport anime before you know exactly what will happen next but they have some good ideas in how to make the games feel different. Just don't expect twist and turns every episode and you will be fine.\n\nThe show had so much potential and its quite sad that they bottled it a bit. At least for me. Don't get me wrong. It definitely has its moments and the setting is great and screams potential. If you are new to the genre and are a football fan, go for it. You will have fun with Blue Lock. Maybe I expected too much or I'm getting to old for this kind of story. I guess if you are in your teenage years you will see this show with different eyes and probably will enjoy it a lot more than me. \n\nRight in the Middle, no fear of relegation but also far away from Champions League and League Winners.\n\n5/10\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Phidoe (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 17, 2023\n\ntcandy19\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Did everyone write their review before all 24 episodes was aired or something? I mean no one is talking about the absolutely unforgivable CGI usage. Its so painful to the eyes, it feels incredibly soulless and stiff. The animators mustve been held at gun point and forced to finish the series ASAP to ride the hype of the manga i guess cause theres no way anyone couldve thought this crap was acceptable. It was so hard to get into the goals and the one on ones because the animation was so horribly done it mightve been better to watch some child try to recreate the\n\n...\n\nmanga scene with toys in stop motion. \n\nMoving on from the horrible animation, lets talk about the story itself. Imagine some high school kid randomly getting a letter from the soccer association, showing up to a meeting in a sketchy building where they ask 300 of them to voluntarily commit themselves to what is essentially a prison and then just play soccer day in and day out. Lets be serious. I mean honestly. What parent would allow their child to miss weeks and weeks of school for a supposed chance to become ‚Äúthe best striker in the world‚Äù. Im not saying anime has to be realistic always but like atleast have some basis in reality?? I cant even suspend my disbelief tbh some of this shit is js too silly. \n\nThe characters are basically weird and over the top. We hardly learn anything about any of them. The only thing we even know about the main character is that he lost some match because he passed to a teammate and that pissed him off. Idk if this changes in the manga but for the anime thats how it is for now. Its hard to get invested in any of the characters cause we have no reason to do so. Why should we root for any of these guys? We have no idea about their backstory or what drives them. Just some lame ass shtick like for bachira hes always like ‚Äòi have a monster inside of meü§ì‚Äô or barou is like ‚Äòim the king you donkeys‚Äô omg and the worst dialogue is for sure ‚Äòi need to devour him‚Äô or whatever the hell. \n\nWhich leads me to the actual gameplay itself. The gameplay is very boring technical references to stuff in soccer. If you like soccer maybe you‚Äôll like it. They be saying shi like ‚Äòomg he did a triple nutmeg‚Äô or ‚Äôi need to evade blah blah and make my direct shoot my main power‚Äô like just going on and on about minor details during the match. ‚ÄòWe need to create a chemical reaction to get this point‚Äô PLEASE stfu jesus. On top of it its so hard to follow what theyre saying cause the matches are either practically still frames or really shit CGI. \n\nOverall, blue lock is objectively terrible. As an anime. I am going to give the manga a chance cause i have a feeling a lot of stuff didn‚Äôt translate well to animation. Some of the weird story stuff is just ass tho and has nothing to do with the poor animation. For me, blue lock is like junk food. Objectively I know I shouldnt bother with it and that its bad, but i kinda just keep watching it cause its not really boring as per se. Like i‚Äôll tune in and not really pay attention. Just like a bag of chips you just eat when youre bored or something, not cause you really love it - thats basically how i view blue lock.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by tcandy19 (\n19\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 18, 2022\n\nLordOfTwitchChat\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (6/24 eps)\n\n There are a lot of mixed reviews here. As far as I can see a lot of people are coming into sports anime expecting the complete rules/definitions and framework of the actual sports being absolutely identical to what the anime is trying to represent and teach to all the viewers. So I'll try break some of it that bias first.\n\nThat notion is completely and utterly wrong and stupid on its own. Its like expecting Shaolin football to have realistic representation of Shaolin and football. Lets be real, you're not getting that and if you think MUST get that in order for the anime to be\n\n...\n\ngood. You're likely just delusional and incredibly biased.\n\nThe anime does bend the perception of what real football looks like, but the goal of anime shows whether they are sports OR NOT is definitely not give you educational knowledge of the real game. Its to grab your attention and take you for a journey that excites and captures your attention. This fact alone is completely ignored by confused reviewers and viewers alike that fail to grasp this notion about it. For anyone who has watched almost ANY of the sports anime, despite some trying to capture the real sport. Not a single thing of them is completely and utterly 100% realistic to the real deal. Think Kuroko No Basket. Is it a good Anime? Great. Is it realistic in representing the actual game? Cmon now, there's people disappearing in thin air and people jumping from like half court to dunk. Even haikyuu has some moments where it is vastly beyond realistic in terms of representing how much a volleyballer can actually do in a game. How about Galactic football for those older who have watched the Jetix animations and cartoons? Those dudes be flying everywhere on the court. Are they great animes and animations with great story? Absolutely. Hajime no Ippo and Kengan Ashura? Dudes are getting slammed with the power of 10 trucks and standing back up. \n\nLets not talk about some ppl hitting concrete like its cotton pillows. Most of these are very good anime nonetheless.\n\nSo for all you who are wondering if to watch it, ask yourself. Do you want perfect realism of a sport game exactly as it is in real life to the T, or do u want a great and exciting anime about football. Personally I watch animes for the sake of the anime. If I wanted realism and educational content, I'd be watching a documentary not anime :)\n\nThere is one notion that keeps getting bashed in some of the other reviews.\n\nIs this anime potentially selling that a sport is comprised of a single role filling every position? \n\nThat aspect itself absolutely does not matter. The anime sets the grounds for the story and the character development to happen. In what way, shape or form is absolutely not required to fit the description of the football playbook. There could be a thousand Goalkeepers if u will, that does not matter. \n\nRating-wise\n\nAnimation: 10/10: Stunning and visually appealing.\n\nSound 10/10: Sound effects, and music is completely on point and sets a good tone for each situation\n\nVoice Acting 10/10: At a bare minimum most of your favorite anime Voice Actors are voice one or more of the characters in there. \n\nThat's right. If u have watched any recent anime, especially the likes of Tokyo Revengers, Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu, chances are one or more of your favorite Voice Actors from them are in this anime as well. Top quality and well known ones.\n\nCharacters and Character Development 8/10: So far we have seen a bit from some, from others not so much and some are kind of killed off before their backstory or any information about them is fully revealed. There is not a lot of backstory to each of the currently focused characters besides the MAIN one.\n\nStory 9/10: Its definitely a great start for a story that could spin in any direction. There is tension and despite people saying its predictable, they would not be able to tell you what even happens in the next episode.\n\nOverall 9.5/10: There seems to be a lot ahead of time, and there seem to be more exciting characters ahead on the horizon as well.\n\nIf you're fresh out of good anime to watch, you'd likely not regret this\n\nIts probably not a clean masterpiece. But its damn sure more exciting than most of the crap releasing nowadays.\n\nIf you have watched Kuroko/Haikyuu/etc, and have a basic ability to let your imagination take in the story as it is, and not what your self-biased perception of what it SHOULD be drag your impressions of it. Then you're in for a good anime.\n\nIf i were you I'd ignore all of the wonky Not Recommended reviews up and down in this section as they mostly don't do any justice whatsoever to this anime. \n\nThis review might be looked at weirdly by some, but it is a humble attempt to give some newsflash to those who come expecting an anime to fit THEIR perception and bias rather than enjoy it for what it is. \n\nEnjoy to watch, and Watch to enjoy.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by LordOfTwitchChat (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 4, 2023\n\noponent\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (3/24 eps)\n\n Riding on the hype for the real life soccer Word cup 2022 in Qatar, the anime was released at the perfect time to be overhyped (even using names of the irl players participating), grabbing more viewers than just the fans of sports anime. \n\nStory:\n\nHaving that more audience worked as its advantage since as a sport anime its terrible in comparison, failing in every aspect that makes a sports anime a good sports anime, throwing out of the window everything related to tactics, analyzing opponents, teamwork, will, self-improvement as a player and as team, specific practice to improve specific skills, rivals (between teams or in-teams), action,\n\n...\n\ncharacters interactions/development/synergies, ect...\n\nVery quickly turns into a SquidGames-kind of game instead, where the show pretends to make the Main Character seem like the underdog (being told it is considered the 2nd worst player participating) which is bull because his skills are at the same level as the other players. It even contradicts itself because the main motivation for the MC is him being angry about being so much better than everyone else and his team being trash, speaking of which:\n\nThe Main Character:\n\nEverything about him is bad, he is not the underdog as the show makes tells you to be (contradicting what they're showing, a underdog would surprass their obstacles with superior tactics, harder training, stronger will or barely scrapping by, which is not the case since he brute forces through everything, gets the undeserved plot-armor luck and gets carried by another guy as plot-convinience), and he's not likeable either, he has the typical bland black haired protagonist design meant to be a self-insert, his motivations are shallow at best (wanting to become the best striker) and despicable at worst (trashing on everyone else and his teammates), having this edgelord mentality of 'I don't need any friends or a team, I'm a lone wolf', very depicted on the art style, making the edgy faces for MC multiple times, burning that image in your mind. His main objective is not being a better player, but a selfish one, making the viewer not wanting to root for him.\n\nIt is fine to have characters like this though, when a character starts with negative personality traits, it means they have room to grow up and become better, that's called 'character development', in another show it would: forcing that character out from their original and desired position, make them sit in the bank instead of being in the field, make them lose the match because of their errors; but not in this anime, it wants to be so edgy that not only the MC was never called out of his bad personality, but it is rewarded for it, since it's said the Blue Lock's objective is to create the 'most selfish striker who doesn't rely on his team, the biggest piece of shit person'.\n\nConclusion:\n\nHeavily carried by animation and well timed date of airing. It wants to tell a story of a edgelord self-insert MC with backwards character development, poor to non-existent storytelling, zero likeable characters (all of them being egoists, which is the point of the Blue Lock itself), and a poor excuse of a sports anime. The message trying to convey is that 'be a piece of shit and rely on no one to succeed in a team sport' disregarding every position in soccer that isn't called \"striker\".\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by oponent (\n24\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 29, 2023\n\nWDUNE\n\nRecommended\n\n \"I crushed‚Ä¶ the dreams of these eleven people\"\n\nBlue Lock is almost like nothing you've seen before in sports anime. It's not about some goody-two-shoes protagonist aiming to be the best with no consequences. This story is impressive because it shakes up the usual character roles and adds real stakes, risking their whole careers if they lose.\n\nThe suspense and different vibes you get from this quick-paced anime will keep you glued to the screen. I haven't binged an anime like this in a long time! The storytelling grabs you and the end of each episode leaves you craving for more. It's like a juicy teaser that\n\n...\n\nkeeps you hooked. Damn, I loved it!\n\nThis anime is a visual feast with its vibrant and lively colors that create seamless and captivating scenes. While some anime struggle with the balance of using 3DCG and 2DCG, this show manages to merge these technologies effectively, except for a drop in quality during the post-credit scenes.\n\nThe presence of inner monsters within certain characters adds an exciting element, and the use of 3DCG works well to portray these demonic forms that enhance their abilities. The auras that manifest around their eyes, legs, and entire bodies effectively convey the intense excitement of these characters. Despite the visual indicators of fictional powers like glowing eyes and auras, the anime remains grounded without any actual superpowers or fake abilities. Though some characters may appear unrealistically talented and powerful, the power scaling, although a bit exaggerated, remains within acceptable limits.\n\nOne of the vulnerabilities in making sports stories and especially animes is that there are never enough movements/gameplaying compared with the script/speech which forces writers to interrupt the playing (match) in a clich√© way... because otherwise, the episode would just be a football match and 10 minutes long.\n\nThere is a lot of overexplaining and clarifying the already clear situations most of the time, which makes it frustrating to watch... every move has to be explained and what makes it worse is that sometimes the opponents start explaining and giving away their secret weapon tactics... which makes no sense... it's just annoying... I felt that the most during the match against Team W... with the provocative twins.\n\nSomething I didn't understand is the body positions when passing, shooting, or receiving the ball... these positions are imbalanced and don't give the real perspective of a body shape and form while doing these things.\n\nThe whole idea of the Blue Lock doesn't really make sense... to filter the best young strikers in Japan to find, develop, and graduate the best striker in the world to win Japan the world cup... but for real, and jokes aside, what if they succeed with their plan and they give japan the best striker in the world... they qualify to the world cup and in the first game... the striker gets injured!!! How did something this important not get to their mind making this process... ok let's say this striker is indestructible, unbreakable, powerful, flexible, and won't get injured... what about the rest of the team??? The 10 other guys that will help him... what if the team they face in the wc finals had some project like the Blue Lock project, but which is made to produce the best defender ever and they succeed to produce a defender that is so good that he could stop Blue Look's best striker...then what?\n\nOkay, another scenario... what if Japan's wc manager plays in a formation that needs more than one striker... what will they do? Will they get the #2 best striker?? But they said if you lose, you will never play for the national team ever...\n\nSo, long story short, while Blue Lock offers great action, suspense, and entertainment, it falls short in paying attention to these crucial details that would enhance the overall story. As a result, the anime may feel incomplete and lacking in careful consideration of its plot elements.\n\nThe worst and most annoying thing in Blue Lock is the characters' personalities... I understand that a character is handsome and that he has the beauty of heavenly creatures, but I don't need to be reminded of that every single sentence this character speaks... same with strong characters showing off their strength and fast characters showing off their speed... for example, Aryuu Jyueube is obsessed with beauty... Chigiri Hyouma is obsessed with speed... Aoshi Tokimitsu is so shy, afraid, and respectable... nagi is so lazy... like we understand this so don't show it LITERALY every sentence they speak... the point is; With the exception of some of the main major characters, characters' personality building is just trash.\n\nRatings:\n\nStory: 7.5/10. The story is fine to good, but it's the manner of events that made it special and The way the story was processed and developed. It's Easy to predict the upcoming events mostly not impressive, but still entertaining... And surely there are these moments where you get your mind blown by what just happened but these are very few.\n\nArt Style: 8/10. Great facial expressions and showing emotions... drawing auras and body flows and streamlines, exhaustion, rage, enthusiasm, sadness, shock, agitation, intimidation.. all were perfectly delivered.\n\nAnimation: 8.5/10. Outstanding animation, Visuals, in general, are amazing and mistake-free except for the post-credit scenes and a few short scenes along the anime. The production, animation, and art levels dropped a bit in the second half of the anime...\n\nMain characters: 8/10. Amazing major characters who would've been perfect if not for the annoying personalities.\n\nCharacters minor: 5/10. If it weren't for some characters I would've given it 3/10... Diversity in their designs and skills and abilities is superb, but as I said before, the personalities of especially the minor (secondary) characters are TRASH.\n\nMusic: 6.5/10. The music isn't that interesting... not too good but not bad... I sometimes just skip the opening. The opening was average and the ending is good but the OSTs and sounds were terrific... great work was done by the sound engineering staff.\n\nOp.1 6.5/10 Ed.1 7/10\n\nOp.2 5/10 Ed.2 5.5/10\n\nArcs and Events: 8.5/10. The ideas of the selections are just brilliant, the suspense and thriller were unmatched.\n\nAntagonists: 7/10. Every character inside the Blue Lock is an antagonist to the rest of the characters, and I like that. Plus the actual good antagonists show up towards the end of the anime, the ones in the first are just beginners.\n\nEnjoyment: 9/10. Watching Blue Lock is like a wild ride that gets your heart racing, making you feel all pumped up and excited. The intense matches hit you right in the feels, keeping you on the edge of your seat and begging for more.\n\nOverall: 7.5/10. Good - Very good.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by WDUNE (\n23\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 8, 2023\n\nmohd711\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (17/24 eps)\n\n [Spoiler-Free]\n\n\"Blue Lock\" is a high-stakes sports anime that has its fair share of pros and cons. On the one hand, the animation is -more or less- good. However, during the more intense action scenes, the animation quality takes a hit, with the use of CGI being particularly noticeable and sometimes detracting from the overall experience.\n\nWhen it comes to character design, \"Blue Lock\" is unfortunately underwhelming. The majority of the designs are repetitive, generic, and lacking in unique features. Some of the designs are even unappealing to look at. Additionally, the representation of football in this anime is unrealistic and not reflective of the sport.\n\nAnother issue\n\n...\n\nwith the anime is the random and lengthy monologues that the characters give in order to explain their thought-process and the state of the field. These monologues not only kill the intensity of the action, but also detract from the overall experience, making it less engaging for the audience.\n\nThe most disappointing aspect of \"Blue Lock\" are the nonsensical terms used by the characters. Terms like \"weapon,\" \"skill,\" \"turn zero into one,\" \"find the chemical reaction,\" and \"copy someone's weapon\" are spouted without any real understanding of the training and development that goes into becoming a successful football player. The author treats skill development as a game of points and upgrades, rather than the hard work and dedication that it requires in reality.\n\nIn conclusion, while \"Blue Lock\" has the potential to be a great sports anime, its shortcomings in character design, unrealistic representation of the sport, and random and lengthy monologues make it less impactful and enjoyable for the audience.\n\n\"Blue Lock\" fails to live up to the standards set by other sports anime like Haikyuu. If you are looking for a well-rounded anime that boasts a diverse cast of compelling characters, a realistic and accurate depiction of the sport, outstanding animation, and a mature approach to skill development and talent, then this anime is not the right choice for you.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by mohd711 (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 26, 2023\n\naemniversary\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n I am not a sports anime fan but Blue Lock manages to pique my interest because it has the appeal towards action shounen fans. \n\nThe idea for the story is really interesting : A football battle royale for strikers.\n\nBlue Lock the most unorthodox approach towards football and that is one of the reasons why it stands out compared to other football anime. Instead of regular training arc and the power of friendship to pull through each match, Blue Lock skips those training montage and tries to nurture the egoism in these characters during matches. The show is also fast paced which adds more oomph to\n\n...\n\nthe story development. Definitely sounds like a good show but it fell off once the story is stuck between the border of realistic and fiction.\n\nThe characters refer to their skills as \"weapons\" > There are visualization effects to portray character's growth > These visualization effects become canon > The show introduces more characters with quirky personality (not exactly in a good way sometimes) > Somehow the term \"devour\" becomes a common thing to say in this show.\n\nIf you still think it is realistic, you need heavy dose of grass touching.\n\nNext, this is what I stumbled upon reading the manga :\n\nI started reading the manga just before the rematch with the top 3 arc and this is where I discovered that the manga has more movement than the anime itself. That does not make any sense but it is true. The anime just merely adapting those manga panels without fully utilizing the animation medium to its fullest. The anime just mostly uses explanation which makes the imaginative process of the character's movement in the manga seems more fluid.\n\nAfter that, sport fans can probably justify this but for me, there are quite a few minor retcons in the show. It is when a character is in a 1v1 situation and suddenly got intercept by another character. The fact that even the reactions from surrounding characters are surprised to see that character suddenly appears makes it feel like a cheap surprise. It is understandable in the manga that it is hard to display the positioning of all the characters on the field due to the manga panelling and the dialogue taking up spaces. However, this can be fixed in the anime but did the anime actually solves the issue? Well, yes and no. The good thing is they use overview shots of the field (the one with the characters being replaced with CGIs) from time to time so we can see the movement and the positioning of the characters on the field. The bad thing is that the anime just merely adapting those manga panels so it kinds of beat the purpose when we actually need to know the positioning of the characters.\n\nOverall thought :\n\nWell, color me surprise.\n\nNot only this show is one of the highest rated football anime but it is mostly being carried by hype and not the quality of the show itself. I complaint about all this and yet I am also one of those people being pulled into this show because of hype. The animation kind of dropped after the first half of the show and my guess is the use of those visualization effects caused it to be that way.\n\nAfter that, despite a vast range of characters, most of the characters are kind of cringe though. A dude that thinks that the football field is a battlefield, a dude that only knows the word \"Glam\" and a dude with a superiority complex that thinks he is a villain that devours the light. It would be nice if Blue Lock were to set the premise of the story as pure fiction so you know what to expect from it.\n\nDespite all that, the show is still enjoyable because you can enjoy the adrenaline rush from it and I like the opening and the ending songs. The second opening especially is catchy and has the best opening visual so it is hard to skip it every week.\n\nI recommend you to watch it if you like action shows and I do not recommend you to watch it if you are into slice of life and regular sports anime.\n\nWhat I hope for the U20 arc (spoiler alert) :\n\nSeeing that the announcement for the second season is already out, I am quite disappointed but at least I know what to expect this time. Well, this is true if 8Bit decides to include U20 arc with the third selection arc in the second season\n\nOriginally, I hope that the U20 arc would be a movie because the arc is definitely the best arc from Blue Lock as of now. If they actually manage to animate the whole thing carefully and stopped relying on the characters to explain everything that is going on, it is going to be pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. Seeing the Itoshi brothers going up against each other, Shidou Ryuusei being an absolute menace, the characters trying to overcome the U20 defense and Isagi's lucky shot is definitely going to be a nice closure for the movie. \n\nWell, that is it for my review.

Gets a chance at Blue Lock where they want to find the best striker in Japan. The structure of Blue Lock means that if you don't pass their various tests, you get eliminated. What's even worse is that your career as a striker is over. I think this premise is completely dumb. There\n\n...\n\nare PLENTY of real life examples of people who are late bloomers. But this joker, Ego thinks it's fine to ruin someone's career at the age of 17? What?\n\nAnime is also full of cringe dialogues like demons and \"We aRE STriKeRS\". I almost thought this was gonna turn into some pseudo vampire sports anime when it got that that episode with Bachira, the guy who yaps on about demons and monsters inside us. lol like what?\n\nCarried by animation.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Tokisaurus (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 2, 2022\n\nAkariZenpai\n\nMixed Feelings\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (8/24 eps)\n\n Eh? I've been seeing a lot of people saying Japan's way of playing this World Cup 2022 is similar to Blue Lock so I gave it a watch (and read) but guess what? It's not similar at all. Nah uh. Not in the slightest. \n\nThey go like, \n\n\"Omg blue lock is right!\" (right with what??)\n\n\"Japan must have watched/read blue lock\" (I highly doubt that)\n\n\"The strategies are similar!\" (No dude stop‚Äî)\n\nNO. Nuh ah dude are you kidding me?üòÇAs a Japanese, I'm insulted that you compared this anime to my beloved country's footballers.\n\n-------------\n\n...\n\nStrategies ‚Äî Blue Lock's football strategies are mess and inaccurate. Highly inaccurate. It's like throwing all ideas but failed to explain it or right to say, the author doesn't know what he's talking about. Do he even know football? Don't expect too much game strategies here cuz there's only one or two. Don't also expect football knowledge here cuz you will not learn a thing. \n\nPlot ‚Äî It's unrealistic with a hint of supernatural. Concept is not that bad, y'know all about strikers but my problem is, it's written so badly. World building is repetitive and boring. Nothing sticks with me so far aside from one thing: The anime's major plot twist right now is swapping team mid match, y'know the player can betray his teammates and score a goal for the other team instead. Yeah it's allowed to blue lock. Like wtf is that? It's one of blue lock's strategies when playing so tell me, how is this similar to Japan in world cup right now hmm??? \n\nCharacters ‚Äî one of my big problem on this series. They're forgettable and one dimensional. And overpowered. They think the same and talk the same. They're idiots. Bachira is the only tolerable character for me so far and he's not even the main character. Isagi sucks. \n\nAnimation ‚Äî decent. You can tell that the studio has never animated sports before with the way they animate. Facial expressions are overly exaggerated but I think it's the art style not the animation. \n\nDialogues ‚Äî Bad. I don't know where they're getting all those irrelevant life quotes and logics. It's not even about football. When people heard blue lock, they immediately thinks \"badass\" or \"cool\" but it's actually the opposite. It's childish and stupid. So not cool.\n\nMusic & OST ‚Äî Not good but not bad. Decent I guess. Not to my liking.\n\nSeriously, there are plethora of \"wrong\" in this anime. \n\nOverall blue lock is a disappointment and a failure as a football anime. Those who are not fans of football might like and tolerate this kind of anime, but real football fans surely not. If they do, then good for them.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by AkariZenpai (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 3, 2024\n\nTheEmeraldSphinx\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n The storyline of the anime is quite a cool concept of play or die style as everything is a once in a lifetime opportunity and if you fail that's it.the end. I really like that but the animation for the whole thing just brings it down for me. If not for that this would be a total 10 for me no questions asked but because of the lackluster and sometimes downright sloppy animation, it goes down to an 8 for me. If not for the storyline this anime would definitely barely be a 4 but as the story is completely butchered by the anime,I recommend\n\n...\n\nhighly reading the manga.\n\n:)\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheEmeraldSphinx (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 5, 2024\n\nApolloD\n\nRecommended\n\n This anime genuinely changed my point of view on life. A major theme of this show is that you have to always believe that you can win to actually win. If you don‚Äôt go through life thinking you are on top, then what‚Äôs the point? I doubt this is the best message a show can tell, but it is a useful one. \n\n Anyways, moving on to the actual plot of the anime it follows a high school football/soccer player (I‚Äôm going to call it football for this review) named Isagi Yoichi after he\n\n...\n\nthrows away his shot, literally, in an important match for his team. He then gets called to a program called blue lock ran by a crazy guy named Ego who informs all 200 strikers there that they aren‚Äôt selfish enough and that they need a bigger ego. We then are introduced to a fun cast with a wide variety of different characters all aiming for the same goal as they gradually get knocked out throughout the challenges Ego sets for them.\n\n This anime had me hooked and I was so excited to watch the next episode every single time I finished one. I am hyped for the movie and season two that are eventually gonna come out. Really great anime and I would recommend.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ApolloD (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nnashyyyyyyy\n\nRecommended\n\n No one wants to hear rants about proper football or soccer. You don't have ball knowledge bro. Yes no shit the striker isn't the end all be all. Obviously egotistic players end up being on the bench more often than not. It's a fucking anime. Blue Lock is cringe at times I won't deny it, specifically bachira. There plenty of the shonen bullshit of \"i'm gonna become the best in the world\". Isagi really has no complex backstory as a character, and I like it like that, no bullshit, no nothing. It's about a guy who passed to his teammate for a tap-in and the\n\n...\n\nguy fucking missed from five yards out. He told himself fuck it, i'll do it myself. The show is unrealistic, puzzle pieces are flowing out of Isagi's head while he is thinking and motherfuckers like Barou and Rin are scoring cornerkicks and from kick-offs lmao. Hell Japan didn't even do that bad in the world cup in 2022, they topped a group with spain and germany, but they are talking about failure in the 2018 WC. In any case, blue lock is fucking hype as hell. Forget about your bayern munich, your real madrid, man city. This is an unapologetic take on how the game is played. It's all about the striker baby, all about yourself, creating goals, and stealing other people's attributes. The show is hype and the plot develops very well. The premise of Blue Lock, 300 fighting for a shot at the national team and world glory is brilliant. Without spoiling, watching Isagi's development is brilliant and the recently announced season two will cover the results of blue lock and it will be absolutely fun to watch. From an enjoyment standpoint, blue lock was a 9/10 for me, I just think that the animation was lacking, and the show was too cringe/unrealistic at times. You kinda have to turn your brain off. There was also some unnecessary character backstories. One thing in particular that I like is that compared to other shonen, blue lock doesen't spout the same crap about teamwork and friendship all the time, it is unapologetic and ruthless which makes for a more refreshing and better viewing experience. Finally, Isagi does not get too much plot armor, which is a big plus, especially in a sports anime for me. Obviously the MC needs some plot armor but every episode was truly unpredictable, which is Blue Lock's biggest plus for me, Isagi's success wasn't all that much more likely than his failure, and he does fail from time to time. It wasn't so ambiguous that I would think he'd get eliminated from blue lock but I still think that it was done really well. Overall, blue lock is worth a try, even if you don't know football/soccer all that well, I thought it was brilliant even though it doesen't match up with the real thing at all, but what do you expect from an anime, it's for entertainment, it's not a documentary contrary to the beliefs of the football elitists on myanimelist reviews who think blue lock is shit because of their self-proclaimed football knowledge which makes the show \"disrespectful.\" 8/10 thanks for reading, -nashy\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by nashyyyyyyy (\n82\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 26, 2023\n\ntake0kun\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (20/24 eps)\n\n It's unlike any sports anime you've watched before.\n\nI'm on the edge of saying Blue Lock is revolutionary - in its concept, storytelling, and animation. There are a lot of factors at play within the story, but the plot itself is straightforward. Who can become the best striker to lead Japan's team in the World Cup? And there are a series of rigorous and cruel training/challenges. Each stage/challenge breaks down a soccer concept to its basics to force the players to evolve and surpass their previous selves.\n\nThe pacing is both slow and fast in a way where the story itself doesn't progress fast, but the scenes\n\n...\n\nare animated to make your heart go doki-doki. And the sound effects? My gad, it hypes up the anime even more. Have you heard of a powerful goal that hits the net? WHOOSH, this anime says. \n\nThe characters are also so very interesting and have their own niche and backstory. The only caveat I have is that the MC is kind of annoying but only because he whines a lot before he realizes how he can grow. I'm not a big fan of his over-analyzation (because sometimes it feels like he's overcompensating for his lack of physical talents). Though I suppose that's part of the story. But since I'm on ep20, he's becoming more tolerable.\n\nOverall. I can't wait for more episodes. I can never tell what can happen in each episode because this anime is not afraid of losses. If you want to watch someone win and win, then this isn't for you. There are many losses here, some losses that you won't even see coming. BUT there's always growth. No character stays in a slump for too long, everyone has drive. And that itself is the very energy that pushes this anime to great heights.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by take0kun (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nPrevious\n - \nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

That's where\n\n...\n\nBlue Lock was such a surprise, It filled the void that Haikyuu left for me, giving me the adrenaline rush and excitement that comes with watching nail biting moments that Characters find themselves in and them growing and evolving in front of your eyes. That's the most important thing that Blue Lock gets right, \n\nI haven't felt this much hype from an anime in a long time, every episode, especially in the 2nd cour was incredibly fun. Blue Lock does this very well because of it's unique concept which gives the writing a lot of scope to always stay fresh and try something different. One of the things about Sport anime is that it can get a little repetitive and predictable as time goes on, In the first few episodes of Blue Lock I was worried this would happen because it seemed like all the characters were in one place and you kind of felt that things were going to go in a manner that was predictable and limited but surprisingly Blue Lock never finds itself in such a predicament, it keeps switching up and goes in directions you do not expect. Another aspect of the show that really makes it stand out is it's \"ego\" ideology, a usual dynamic of sports anime is about friendship and teamwork and togetherness, but blue lock takes the opposite approach where characters are tested on how selfish they are, in that way I think it captures the harsh, brutal reality of sports. When protagonist Isagi is introduced you wonder how such a player is going to make it through this, but his development throughout the 24 episodes have been fantastic, the writing does not force his growth but wonderfully makes him evolve in a very believable and practical way by taking him and also us deep through the many layers of how football is played, it's about the tactics, the skills that one acquires, how he acquires it and applying it in-game, some of these games are like chess, it's brilliant. \n\nIt's truly refreshing to see something like this, a sports anime that experiments with a lot of fun and interesting characters, exploring it's unique concept and thesis and doing so in a way that's true to football but also executing it with great animation and sound and making something that explodes with it's entertainment value. Just give me the second season already.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by tigermaskshinobi (\n34\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 30, 2023\n\nBabyGirl06301\n\nRecommended\n\n I can't be the only one who got Squid Games vibes from Blue Lock, but I hope someone else besides me also got Fall Guys vibes, too. I watched this anime because of how absolutely ridiculous it seemed, and I was entirely ready to watch an insane sports anime that made no logical sense, and you know what? I had a great time doing just that. It's about as unbelievable as Kuroko no Basket is in its representations of skills and abilities, but that's what made it so fun. Not only that, but it crafted this atmosphere of desperation and high drama that made it\n\n...\n\nstick out from others in this genre. It was a sports anime, sure, but there were plenty of moments that made it feel like an action or a horror. But, Blue Lock wasn't just about being crazy in its concept--I also found that it shatters a lot of the conventions we see in other sports anime. One of the bigger ones is the greed all of these characters carry--generally, we get sports anime that focuses on teamwork and winning as a collective, but not in Blue Lock. Of course there is teamplay going on throughout the story, but what these characters crave and what the story praises is a sort of narcissism on the field. Characters have to be merciless to advance, and this is actually presented at the goal of the anime--discovering which character is egotistical enough to win. I just found that so fun, even if that isn't something you'd want to see in other sports anime.\n\nI did find the use of analogies, metaphors, and abstract imagery in Blue Lock to be a bit too heavy-handed a lot of the time, which I did find slightly irritating, depending on how often they were hammering it in throughout the matches. Sports anime are no strangers to creating unique languages and concepts to explain extraordinary techniques and plays, but Blue Lock stamped it into the ground a bit too much for my tastes. Really, that's the only negative I have about the experience--the pacing of the matches were amazing and didn't drag on too long, the important characters all felt unique and prominent enough for me to care about them, and the story left me with enough to be intrigued by to get excited about the next season. I knew, once I saw that this was coming out, that it was going to be a good time, but I didn't expect to find so much to love about Blue Lock. I'm glad the anime turned out to be a diamond in the rough.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by BabyGirl06301 (\n376\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 26, 2023\n\nDivinityV12\n\nRecommended\n\n Great Football anime centred around strikers touching from the different physical aspects to mental.\n\nAlthough this anime isn't meant to be taken seriously like Ao Ashi was, this anime focuses more on the climactic side of football which is as you'd guessed scoring the goal, which can be done in many different ways and the evolution process and how a player can add to his arsenal (Bottlers) to score a goal.\n\nThe main issue I had with this anime was the all striker teams. It doesn't work and doesn't give everyone a fair chance infront of goal. But the faster you get your head around the\n\n...\n\nfact that this is more of a shonen anime and they just do this to get around how they'll play against other teams with the triangle and squares rule in football then you'll be able to enjoy this show.\n\nWith that out of the way this Football anime can be seen as the Fairy tail version of Ao Ashi with it touching on more climactic and intense situations with people being given little to no second chances and that their whole football career rides on being the best in blue lock, with extreme development and situations on the pitch which which are eventually overcome through having the strikers mindset and learning from others to then be able to use on the pitch. Where as in Ao Ashi it's paced down and realistic to a degree with that show actually having more than just strikers in the whole team, substitutions and development of the different aspects of different positions.\n\nSo Overall I would give this a 9 but they said this weird incorrect word called soccer too much which doesn't mean anything but what the yanks call american football where you carry an egg shaped thing around with an occasional kick. But that's what you get when you're a US vassal state as you also get their stupidity. \n\nSo it gets a well deserved 8.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by DivinityV12 (\n95\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 27, 2023\n\nMarco_Yooo\n\nRecommended\n\n THIS IS A SPOILER-FREE REVIEW\n\nThe sports anime genre has been one of my first introductions to anime. But it seems that the last few years have been lacking quite a bit. Haikyuu has been the only one that remained consistently good and besides that, there isn´t that much new coming out. But 2022 has seen the rise of two football shows: „Ao Ashi“ last summer, a show which i already reviewed, set the tone for what was to come, but the other one turned the genre completely on it´s head: „Blue Lock“.\n\nStory – 9/10\n\nOkay, i will have to compare this to other anime of the\n\n...\n\ngenre because this show deviates quite a bit from the regular sports anime themes. Every other big sports anime before, be it „Slam Dunk“, Haikyuu , Ao Ashi or even more niche titles like „Harukana Receive“ had similar themes: Teamwork, fairness, friendship, selflessness and a lot more of your typical shounen tropes. But Blue Lock turns that whole concept on it´s head. The most important thing is the ego of the player himself, his determination to become the best and how to outclass each other by any means necessary, fair or not. \n\nThe whole story itself is incredibly unrealistic and over the top. But the show never asks for the viewer to take it seriously. No matter how many insane things happen in here, you just accept it. In contrast, Ao Ashi has been a highly realistic depiction of the game, where everything was about pre-planning, space-awareness, formations and overview of the game. Blue Lock however breaks down the concept of football and plays with it in a very metaphoric way. \n\nThe author found some really interesting formats to take the characters through, essentially turning the whole anime into one, giant tournament arc. You have 11 vs 11, 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3 and even players who have to prove their skills alone ,while Ao Ashi was always 11 vs 11. But are the plays themselves realistic? On paper, every skill or trick portrayed in the show could TECHNICALLY be performed in real-life, but the depiction is so over the top that your suspension of disbelief is truly tested. Everything about the dialogue and the script is so incredibly….anime. The inner monologue, the emotions, the cuts and everything else is pure shounen. If Blue Lock would be a live-action show, it would probably be the cringiest thing ever, but in anime, it just 100 % works. It is dramatic, it is consistent and it breaks up the formula in an interesting way. I´d even say that the pacing of the show, is the best in sports anime so far, making every second entertaining and a joy to watch. \n\nArt – 9/10\n\nThe art was another high point of the show. First, the character designs are fantastic and for this show, they have to be. There are so many different characters that the viewer has to know so the anime truly tried it´s best to make everyone stand out. During dramatic scenes, they often play around with the art style to convey really intense scenes to the viewer. The camera movement is great when it comes to play. What this anime did really well is the portraying of the different skills. Everything is incredibly fluid and fast. The only two reasons i have to bump this one down is 1) that there are a lot of still shots and 2) the CGI can be a tiny bit distracting sometimes. I still think that CGI was the way to go here because constantly animating every single player on the field would be to hard, but there is still a lot of room for improvement. Also the OPs lock incredible.\n\nSound – 9/10\n\nMan, the soundtrack of this show absolutely SLAPS. Instead of choosing one style of music, Blue Lock implements a lot of different styles all together. Classic piano, heavy-metal and electric guitar riffs, even Techno are all used in different moments, but the soundtrack still feels consistent and fitting. The OPs are both great, especially the fantastic second one has become one of my favourites in the genre. The second ending was also great, especially in the animation department. \n\nCharacters – 9/10\n\nThe amount of memorable characters in this season alone is astounding. Everyone has a trait that makes him stand out, characters appear and reappear seamlessly throughout the season. Isagi himself may be more of a standard shounen protagonist but he has a really interesting approach to the game that works really well. Some of my favourites are the highly skilled edge-god Rin, the fast Chigiri and of course Nagi, who is just a joy to watch on the football field. The show gives the important characters little backstories, shows their motivation for Blue Lock and gives every single game meaning and emotional weight. Be prepared that characters you like will eventually get kicked out of the show. That is just the way it is whether you like it or not. \n\nAnother real stand-out was the Blue Lock Headmaster, Ego. He is the source of all the crazy concepts of the show, and deviates from your typical football trainer both in appearance as well as personality. I can´t wait where these characters will end up. Who will prevail in the end and who will get kicked out and have his dreams crushed in front of him?\n\nEnjoyment – 9/10\n\nI mean, what can you say. Not only did this show come out during the 2022 world cup and japans heartbreaking performance, but it did everything right that it had to. This is pure shounen fun and stands as anime of the season for me. If this show keeps on improving it could become one of the genres finest works. This is a MUST-WATCH for everyone that loves shounen and sports especially football.\n\n- Marco_Yooo\n\nFINAL SCORE - 9/10\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Marco_Yooo (\n89\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\nMoshimochi284\n\nRecommended\n\n I've seen a lot of sports anime, and they are probably one of my\n\nfavorite types of anime. One thing I always look for in my sports\n\nshows is just the right mix of realism and fantasy. You see, while\n\nI want the characters to borderline superhuman, I still want everything\n\nto be dialed back just enough, to the point where it still feels like I'm\n\njust watching a game of whatever sport the anime is about. Based on my\n\nrating, you can probably tell that Blue Lock pretty much nails that\n\nbalance. A lot of anime don't hold up well when you go back to them,\n\nbut I personally still find Blue\n\n...\n\nLock as exciting and jaw-dropping as\n\nwhen I first discovered it.\n\nVisuals: The visuals for Blue Lock are amazing, with one caveat that\n\nI will get to shortly. The art for this show truely captures the\n\nvibrant and frenetic feel of the soccer games played, and also has a \n\nbit of edge that gives the overall look just a little more pop.\n\nSo many other sports annime tend to half-a** the art, and it just\n\nfills me with joy to see Blue Lock go the extra mile. However, as\n\nI said before, there is one caveat. For a lot of the shots of the\n\nfield with multiple players moving about, 3D CGI models are used,\n\nand while it's not that noticeable, it can be off-putting for some\n\npeople. Normally I would get upset at that kinf of thing, but since\n\nthis was probably just used as a cost-cutting measure after all the\n\nmoney that was put into animating the rest of the anime, I'll let\n\nit slide.\n\nCharacters: Much like the art, so many sports anime don't develop their\n\ncharacter properly... But Blue Lock once again breaks the norm! The\n\nshow takes time to develop most of its core cast, and its protagonist\n\nis easily one of its most interesting characters. I'm sick and tired of\n\nbland and generic protagonists, and not just in sports anime, but just\n\nin anime as a whole. It's truly a pleasure to watch Isagi (the MC) grow\n\nand change throughout the course of Blue Lock.\n\nSound: I don't usually even mention the OST in an anime review unless\n\nthere is something worth talking about, so we are already starting off\n\non a positive note. I would consider both openings and ending good enough\n\nto warrant listening to out side of the show, and the background music\n\njust brings the viewing experience to a whole new level. This OST is actually\n\none of the few soundtracks from a sports anime that has more than one good,\n\nstandout song.\n\nOverall Thoughts: This is one of not only my favorite sports anime, but one of\n\nmy favorite anime of all time, and I highly recommend this show to anyone\n\nwho has even the slightest interest in anime. Go have fun, and as\n\nthe Blue Lock players say, stay egotistical.\n\nFinal Rating: 9\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Moshimochi284 (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 16, 2023\n\nTachii\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (17/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock goes far and beyond what you expect a sports anime to be. At face value it has a really simple message. While football (or soccer) is a team sport, you need that moment of intense selfish desire to truly impact the game. So a fictional program is developed to bring out this intense selfish desire. But is that all Blue Lock is trying to say?\n\nI find Blue Lock to be packed with wisdom that can be applied to all facets of life and not just a particular sport. The main character Isagi said this once: \"If it lets me win, I have no\n\n...\n\nissue tearing down everything that makes me who I am.\" He really carries this to heart and embodies it in the entire anime. So much so the art constantly draws Isagi in the form of puzzle pieces and he is constantly restructuring and re-piecing himself together to form a new and better self. \n\nObviously the anime itself is far beyond reality. High school players are doing tricks even the best pros cannot do consistently, and each goal scored are like highlight reels you see once a year in a pro league. But I really enjoy Blue Lock for adding a layer of wisdom. Almost every character brings out a teachable moment. Chigiri is able to face his fear by understanding what his real passions are in life. Nagi recognizes despite the innate talent he has for the game, how fun it truly is to actually try and continuously see how far he can push his talent. Leo faces the issue of being a jack of all trades and master of none. Barou... Barou has one of the more memorable transformations the show has to offer. Each and every character is treated like a protagonist and goes through their own arcs of self-realization and self-improvement. \n\nBlue Lock doesn't explicitly state this, but life is about finding what you're good at, finding joy in doing that thing, and continuously improving your craft amid the pains, the doubts, the fears. For it is growth that keeps life interesting, and hopefully, the author ignites a passion in even one reader to pursue their goals, and to grow and become a better version of yourself. It is a life-long journey, and it will make tomorrow something to look forward to.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Tachii (\n7\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\ngabu_rieru\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n The new generation sports anime. Can we say it's Haikyuu's successor? Famous sports shounen anime (the most famous in the world) full of characters with flashy designs and exuding competition. Generational anime.\n\nIt's not like I didn't enjoy it, I actually felt really excited watching Blue Lock. Sports themes excite me a lot in general, even more so being my favorite sport, football, however, it is difficult to disassociate reason from emotion. For the reason I want to devour these stories right now, I want a new season as soon as possible. However, for the reason, it is notorious that this anime fails in many aspects.\n\nStarting\n\n...\n\nwith your cast of characters. Everyone is extremely well-versed and their ways of adding to the story are so forced that it even seems amateurish in some cases. The animation is very weak and stuck, the direction of the scene is only saved in a few takes and the emotion of the scene is being quite carried by the dubbing. And the way they've approached football this first season leaves me on the back foot. Any minimally assiduous football fan realizes that the sport practiced by them is out of reality, and comparing with Haikyuu, the anime that I consider its predecessor, which works in an exemplary way the sport of volleyball, makes the work of football here seem extremely shallow. Tactics being used in a cliché way, disconnected plays, thoughts completely outside of football, with the sole intention of promoting an action scene, without worrying about the execution. It bothered me a lot. It's a good sports anime but not a good football anime. I hope this point improves next season.\n\nAlready in world lore, it's really exciting to know that the story has world flights as its objective, and that excites me and makes me captivated to continue in the work. Despite all the mistakes and annoyances I had watching, Blue Lock is still a hope for a good generational anime.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by gabu_rieru (\n47\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 15, 2023\n\nParadigmAlter\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (10/24 eps)\n\n This is a great anime!

The protagonist being a clever, cerebral player is a breath of fresh air compared to MCs who simply survive on sheer willpower and \"I gotta train every day!\" mindset. It does a great job of putting you in Isagi's mind while he tries to think of a way through every insurmountable challenge. It makes every game pay off beautifully, and it's only made more intense by the stellar supporting cast, whose\n\n...\n\npersonalities and interpersonal dynamics shine through thanks to the unique setting and high stakes.\n\nUnfortunately, every season it seems like MAL will see a well-reviewed anime doing numbers with amazing animation, watch an episode or two, and decide that its popularity and animation quality are the only reason casual anime viewers are watching. I'm here to tell you that despite this anime having plenty of low-quality, nonsense reviews, this anime is definitely something you'll want to try.\n\nIf you don't like sports anime, I'm positive that the character dynamics and intense plot will keep you interested.\n\nIf, like me, you are a long time sports anime fan looking for a decent entry, hold on to your seat because this show will keep you on the edge all the way through.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by cherrydeluxe (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 2, 2023\n\nDreamshocks\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (16/24 eps)\n\n On the surface this anime is about football but beneath the surface it tackles interesting things. One should definitely not expect that such anime is absolutely identical to our human reality and expect that it will stay true to gravity and other things, this anime like most \"reality\" type based animes like Vinland Saga aswell have their bit of a fantasy in the way that physical actions do happen, i remember people would go and ramble around in the forums that Thorkell was lifting trees, heavy object and slamming people around, while the main character would be jumping like a monkey with robot suit. Such\n\n...\n\nanimes do not remain true to the physical laws but are still based on the physical reality, this doesnt make them bad in any means, its just that if one goes with the expectations that such an anime would follow physical laws to the absolute, he will definitely be dissapointed.\n\nBlue lock has very interesting idea and plot but what i didnt really like about it was that it didnt cover all the fine details that i expected, not many details regarding the facility are properly explained, we only learn with time that the facility is very high tech and has all sorts of AI. Despite that the anime is not that much about the action and the football like in real world, its more about feelings, thoughts, identity and ego. Thats what i loved about it, it tackles interesting topics such as ego and what one should think in the spur of an action. Our characters just like in real world, are smashed by fear, indecision, betrayal, anger, etc. Should one pass the ball while he has the opportunity to score a goal? Should one be egoist and try to score or be empathetic and let his teammate shine? Often our characters in Blue Lock are forced to fight their own darkness while at the same time they have to act and score, their own insecurities and doubts take over just like in real life, we as a human being are often scared or being very indecisive when it comes to making important decisions and this is what this anime is truly about.\n\nAlso Blue Lock has decent animation, very good art and above average music, i honestly expected more action as its a football anime but i went into it knowing that delivering a good football anime is very hard, not only the problems that every anime based on the physical reality has but also that football itself is very big genre and can be tackled in many different ways. Given that its hard to make such an anime/manga i am giving it a solid 9.\n\nI watched every single episode with joy and i couldnt wait to watch the next one as the plot would make me feel excited. Sometimes the outcome is predictable but still the anime has solid plot twists that are rather unexpected.\n\nI recommend this anime to any anime fan because its not that much about football itself as a sport but about emotions and decisions.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Dreamshocks (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 31, 2022\n\ndisruptedsoul\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n As someone who tends to watch football and other sports, this anime turned out to be great! I generally don’t enjoy sports anime that much because they tend to fall on the very anime-ish side of it, for example: Inazuma Eleven where there are literal powers mixed with football. Throws me out of the loop a bit.\n\nThe story accompanies a group of unpolished gems of talent who partake in a sort of experimental training ground to train the next striker that will make the Japanese National Team go to new heights. Participating in this means giving it your all or losing everything, quite literally. \n\nCharacter\n\n...\n\ndevelopment is incremental, steady and nicely done in my opinion. Always ends on a soft cliffhanger that makes you excited for the next weekend. Animation is top-notch, especially considering the intricacy of certain football moves, passes, dribbles, shots… if you liked Kuroko No Basket and Haikyuu you’ll surely enjoy Blue Lock!\n\nIf you’re expecting some intricate plot, don’t watch it. A side note, I don’t understand how people give bad reviews on the note that it’s not a plot-heavy story. Yes… it’s a sports anime? There is no necessity for the in-depth theoretical side of football nor is it wise to suddenly delve deep into the psychology of sports. People on review/list websites, be it here on MAL or for movies, tv series, books, etc, tend to fall into this mistake of consuming a medium they’re not going to enjoy. \n\nUnless you’re being paid to be a critic or an anime connoisseur, just don’t watch what you think you’re not gonna enjoy watching from the trailer/first episode alone. \n\nAnother segment, unnecessary to the review and more of a diverging point of view from the general viewer's opinion.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Dictionary, “ego” has the following meaning:\n\n-\tYour sense of your own value and importance\n\n-\t(psychology) the part of the mind that is responsible for your sense of who you are (= your identity)\n\nUntil now, I believe this anime has shown the importance of valuing ourselves and being confident in our own hard work. Unfortunately, this message is being distorted by a multitude of people who believe the show is advocating for this almost Machiavellian distorted concept of what having an ego means. Everyone possesses an ego to a certain extent, naturally, there’s a point where you injure your own progress in whatever area in your life it might be by being an egoist. Your own ego will never get you anywhere. The point of this show, besides telling a story about football, is to show that the Japanese National Team lacks a “star player” per se. What I mean by that is a player who won’t succinctly follow the popular “passing tactic” that the team currently possess, surrendering and imprisoning the team in this monotonous state which leads to constant and recurrent heartbreaks. This isn’t a story that glamorizes the kind of “egoism” portrayed by popular media (generally the connotations associated with Machiavelli or Stirner), in fact, we see characters getting punished by it and it shows the importance of teamwork. Valuing yourself and trusting yourself over someone doesn’t mean you have to trample over them.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by disruptedsoul (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 27, 2022\n\ncereulian\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n Most I can say is it's okay. \n\nI believe your enjoyment of this series depends on when you watch it.

It's extremely fast paced, and characters are fun and surprisingly get a decent amount of showing throughout even though the MC is Isagi. If we can maintain this level of quality, I'm not going to rag on the CGI too much, the animation quality where it matters definitely hits the mark, but it does break the flow of the episode sometimes but it seems to be a norm now days.\n\nWhere the first season is going to\n\n...\n\nend off is going to be a really special season, and will reach highs like no other sports anime has done before in a long time. I do think this has the potential to overtake Haikyuu! only because it's just barrier of entry, soccer is more well known by a large margin and it came out at possibly the best time possible with the World Cup and the story is better with less down time and continuous progression, which can also be a flaw, but that's an issue later down the road.\n\nStrong 8/10, if they do a great job closing out the season, this can easily be a 9/10. \n\nedit: Okay I always hated that guy and never in my life have been that guy because I don't read much, but I'm glad that I read ahead really early on and experienced all the super hype moments from the Manga. The anime is good, but it doesn't have the same raw energy you get from the beautifully drawn panels, and the pacing flows better too. I still stand by my scoring, but I don't think it'll get that 9/10 otherwise I'd have to give the Manga a 10/10 which it isn't but it's still absolutely amazing.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Mr_Popepo (\n25\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\nidkuhhh\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (16/24 eps)\n\n \"All you ever do is create a temporary genius... This deluded genius then goes off to play overseas totally unprepared, but two or three years later, he's back because he can't produce results due to 'cultural and language barriers' and then he spends the rest of his days as a mid-level player in the domestic league\".\n\nMy taste in anime sucks.\n\nHowever, I can't stand when people call Blue Lock bad and over-hyped but then go on to give Rent A Girlfriend a 7/10. So here's what I honestly think about Blue Lock:\n\n1. Is it carried by animation? Sort of, but what's wrong with that? Am I\n\n...\n\nnot allowed to appreciate how cool that shot Isagi just took was? I honestly could not have cared less if the plot to this anime had about as much depth as Pop Team Epic's because I leave every episode wondering what kind of cool shit I'm going to be able to see in the next one.\n\n2. Is the plot of it really that bad? No. It's written by a guy who was clearly passionate about football and honestly the philosophy isn't so bad. To be honest, Japan do need a more egoistic striker. I mean, sure that isn't going to fix all of their problems but with the amount of play makers they have in their squad- a world-class striker could make all the difference and push them to a semi-final for once. Plus, this is an anime that finally acknowledges that \"teamwork\" and \"friendship\" won't always prevail and that sometimes individual skills will come out on top. You can't tell me that the author knows nothing about football just because he made something that differentiates Blue Lock from other anime. He even highlights one of the biggest problems with Japanese soccer when Ego says \"All you ever do is create a temporary genius... This deluded genius then goes off to play overseas totally unprepared, but two or three years later, he's back because he can't produce results due to 'cultural and language barriers' and then he spends the rest of his days as a mid-level player in the domestic league\". These words were clearly from somebody who has followed Japanese football for years and so don't even try to make the argument that this guy knows nothing about the game. Japan NEEDS a little more egoism in its soccer and when you are raised in an environment where losing means you can just go back to living a normal life it's incredibly hard to cultivate that, thus Blue Lock was born.\n\n3. But what about their backstories? Their backstories, while somewhat generic, are honestly not bad. While I don't want to go into detail about them because I can't remember if Bachira's and Rin's have been revealed yet, they are pretty good. Take Kuon for example: A guy who was always passionate about football and strove to be one of the best. He had a dream to one day take Japan to a World Cup win but he was surrounded by people who weren't nearly as serious as him. They thought it made him weird, and that he wasn't being realistic. If it weren't for Blue Lock, he would probably have given up. I mean, what's the point in playing when the rest of your team are just playing for fun and aren't even serious about it? Then there's Naruhaya: A kid whose parents died in an accident and ever since then he's promised to become a football superstar in order to provide for the rest of his family. Like I said, sure they aren't amazing but they aren't that bad either.\n\n4. WhAt AbOuT tHe OtHeR pOsItIoNs? Are you serious? What even is this point? IT'S A SHOW ABOUT GIVING JAPAN A WORLD CLASS STRIKER WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT? And if you want the \"other positions\" to show up just wait for the u20s arc where Ego uses their abilities to put them into positions where they can shine (E.g. Bachira on the wing).\n\nBasically, it's just fun to watch. Like, really fun to watch. So uh...

Don’t expect have your cosmic paradigms shifted, or sit there after the last ep in a mental health crisis. Watch it to enjoy some fairly basic boys run around sweating and raging in spandex, and imagine who’d top who…. in soccer, in soccer.\n\nThe characters aren’t as loveable as in Haikyuu, but their development tracks are pretty fast and steep, so it’s exciting to watch them grow even if you don’t know a thing about the sport.

This can be applied to the manga too, if you'd like to read it.\n\nNo spoilers\n\nWhenever I see, or have a conversation about Blue Lock, all everyone brings up is that compared to other sport series, this one encourages selfishness over teamwork. Which is true of course, but I think there's a more important, unique characteristic to this show (compared to sport series). It's that people can die in this show. Not literally of course.\n\nI don't have many sport animes under my belt, but even with that few,\n\n...\n\nI got somewhat desensitized to the thrill that this genre can give. To me, in those shows, it lost impact when the main character, or important supports lose a significant match (like a qualifiers to nationals, which is a common goal in this genre). Because it's no big deal in the end, they can just have another crack at it next year. And guess what? They always get to the nationals next year.\n\nIn Blue Lock, however, thanks to the Blue Lock Project's system, if someone loses and drops out of this race-to-be-the-best-striker-in-the-world, they'll lose the right to EVER play football on a national level. Just think about that for a second. If you have a passion of yours, it will be easier. These kids love football. Their dream, their goal is to play this sport professionally,to make a living out of it. They all have their different reasons to why they pursue this career. You might be able to relate to some of them. And then you'll get attached to some of those characters. But only one can survive Blue Lock. 299 kids will have their dreams taken from then. That is inevitable, because that's how Blue Lock works. Therefore it is also inevitable, that one of your favourite characters will be crushed and dropped out, and you will never see them again, because this story is about the one who will be the best among all.\n\nThis is what makes Blue Lock great for me. It not only gives you intense, high on octane matches of football, it also gives you a reason to actually, truly fear for the players. To cheer for them as if their life depended on the game. Because I don't think it's an exaggaration to say, that their reason to live is at stake.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by rodis (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 9, 2023\n\nSoLikeILikeThis\n\nRecommended\n\n Sports anime is a well-known genre that typically features and follow a similar formula: a protagonist with a passion for sports joins a club or some team, meets allies and rivals, trains hard, loses some, wins some, and sets their sights for the top. Most importantly, along the way, they learn lessons about teamwork, friendship, perseverance, sportsmanship, etc.\n\nHowever, Blue Lock is not really your typical sports anime, given the nature of having a controversial project (a facility) designed solely to create the world's greatest striker, and by achieving that aim through a ruthless death/survival game, the anime challenges the conventional tropes of sports anime, presenting\n\n...\n\nthe idea of competition through a relatively new set of lens, one that is driven by egoism rather than altruism. Our boy, Yoichi Isagi, joins Blue Lock in hopes of becoming a better striker but realizes that he has to face his own personal faults (fears, doubts, weaknesses) and competition from his opponents. Subjectively speaking, each player and character has a unique personality, style, and motivation, making them exciting and creating a well-mashed stew of drama due to the characters often conflicting motivations.\n\nAlthough some common critiques of Blue Lock are that it's too unrealistic, exaggerated (anime-type beat), or doesn't represent the essence of team sports like soccer (teamwork). Some might include that the anime is too edgy or over the top, or maybe even critique its plot progression and repetitiveness. \n\nHowever, I think this anime shouldn't be judged as a 1:1 of soccer, in real-life zone (the point of it might be missed there). Instead, Blue Lock is more so a creative exploration of the topic of competition. The anime is to form the idea of EGOISM vs. ALTRUISM in a fun and intense anime. Furthermore, the argument that selfishness or lack of teamwork is unrealistic suggests that this anime's way of forming connections between characters is false, fake, and insignificant. However, one could argue that the premise of Blue Lock not only inspires players' abilities but also inspires/develops unique and unconventional character bonds and relationships. It's just that Blue Lock does it in a fairly complex way. In terms of the anime's edginess, or plot issues, that just comes down to the individual watching it. You could hold the anime's unrealistic/melodramatic narration over its head, or you could just play with it, be in on the ride, and view it as just an honest interpretation of the emotions that come with these characters and stories. It's really just up to you.\n\nAnother cool thing is that Blue Lock also heavily explores the psychological aspects of soccer, such as stress, anxiety, confidence, pressure, motivation, and creativity, all of which are subjectively done in a really cool visual fashion (concepts being broken down into literal puzzle pieces, visually appealing diagrams that give off a blend of sophistication, modernity, and minimalist design elements, with a touch of futuristic and high-tech vibes given the setting). To achieve this psychological exploration, players are forced to adapt and improvise quickly through constant strain caused by various obstacles and scenarios. All of this is powered by Ego Jinpachi, a manipulative and passionate coach who embodies the concept of individualism rather than self-concern for others. The various methods used to provoke and challenge the players help them inspire their full potential and ego.\n\nDespite the criticism, Blue Lock appeals to different audiences with its engaging storytelling and anecdotes. Whether you have never touched soccer before, or maybe you play it every day, you will find something in this anime to enjoy or relate to. The focus on egoism, its fresh and thrilling take on the competition in sports anime, is genuinely what this series is about. And if any of this sounds at all interesting, definitely check this anime out. \n\n(note my numbered rating is exaggerated ok don't take it 2 seriously lol)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SoLikeILikeThis (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 29, 2022\n\nAML1704777\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n In my case this is anime peak sports it's better than haikyu but ace of diamond are still better.

The show focuses on the individual's drive to be the best and how that affects the team dynamic. Unlike other sports anime, Blue Lock utilizes teamwork as a means for the players to grow competitively with each other, rather than as a means for the team to succeed together. Each episode follows a formulaic approach, with the players striving to outdo each other and prove their worth. However, what keeps the formula from becoming stale is the\n\n...\n\ndynamic character interactions and unexpected rivalries that arise.\n\nAlthough the animation quality may not reach the level of Production I.G, the show still holds its own and effectively captures the intense aura around the players. The animation may not be perfect, with some parts relying on CGI and choppy animation, but it does not detract from the overall viewing experience.\n\nOne of the strongest aspects of Blue Lock is the well-developed and dynamic characters. Each player has a unique personality and backstory, adding depth and complexity to their motivations and actions. No character is deemed useless, and even the weaker players have a meaningful reason for their involvement in the game. The constantly shifting alliances and relationships between the players keep the audience on their toes and make for unpredictable and engaging scenarios.\n\nIn conclusion, Blue Lock offers a fresh take on the sports anime genre, exploring the darker aspects of human ambition and the consequences it can bring. Despite its formulaic approach, the show keeps viewers engaged through its dynamic character interactions and unexpected twists. Whether you're a fan of sports anime or just enjoy a good character-driven story, Blue Lock is definitely worth checking out.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Rickey_Rouse (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 9, 2022\n\nnradi\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (5/24 eps)\n\n I am not a fan of sports anime.

Its fortuitous release timing, coinciding with the real-life World Cup, allowed it to capitalize on the heightened enthusiasm surrounding Japan's impressive performance in the tournament. This fortunate synchronicity contributed to a heightened level of hype and influence surrounding Blue Lock.\n\nVisually, the anime shines with its consistently solid animations throughout the entire series. The show boasts a diverse and intriguing cast of characters, although their development falls somewhat short of expectations. However, it's worth noting that character development can often take a backseat in\n\n...\n\nsports anime, where the focus is primarily on the sport itself. The soundtracks, while not groundbreaking, serve their purpose well, aligning with the expectations for a football-themed series.\n\nWhen it comes to football, Blue Lock delivers an abundance of unadulterated fun. While the anime doesn't delve deeply into the intricacies of the sport, this deliberate choice allows for a greater sense of freedom and a heightened emphasis on enjoyment. And enjoyment is precisely what viewers experience as the characters showcase remarkable football skills brought to life through excellent animation. Standout moments featuring characters like Seishiro Nagi are truly awe-inspiring. The sound mixing during intense game sequences effectively immerses the audience, enabling them to feel the impact of powerful shots or the subtlety of nuanced plays.\n\nHowever, it's important to address the somewhat lacking story of Blue Lock. The narrative primarily revolves around a group of kids aiming to make it to the national team through their football prowess. While a few characters possess background stories, these narratives are often underdeveloped and lack significant impact on the overall plot.\n\nOne notable criticism lies in the inconsistent portrayal of power levels and skills among the characters. The first season effectively establishes the top players' exceptional talents and abilities. However, when faced with formidable opponents or the main protagonist himself, these established powerhouses suddenly appear more beatable, often relying on the power of friendship and teamwork to level the playing field. This divergence from the initial premise and exaggerated skill levels can feel jarring and detract from the overall experience.\n\nFurthermore, Blue Lock presents a somewhat perplexing approach to friendship and teamwork. Certain characters, including the main protagonist, occasionally adopt an ego-driven demeanor that contradicts their established personalities. While the narrative initially emphasizes an \"me vs. them\" mentality, it ultimately requires teamwork for progress. It remains to be seen how this narrative dichotomy will be reconciled in future seasons.\n\nDespite its flaws, Blue Lock remains one of the finest sports anime available, offering impressive visuals and a wealth of entertainment. However, as it approaches the peak of football skills in this season, there is uncertainty surrounding its future evolution. There is a lingering concern that upcoming seasons may rely heavily on plot armor. Nevertheless, for now, fans can immerse themselves in the enjoyment of this season of Blue Lock, which earns a respectable score of 7 out of 10.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MrHardTruck (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 22, 2023\n\nJohnnyjoestar33\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n this is one of the top sports anime I've watched in a long time it's kinda corny at times but these are high school kids they're gonna be corny, story wise it's pretty interesting as a concept having a character abandon selflessness in favor for ego and glory is pretty interesting along with the high stakes and fast pace this anime will keep you engaged and nervous with anticipation. also calling this fujo bait is wild they're all pretty average as anime characters go, if you've played soccer/football before this can easily make you want to play again. characters are pretty decent in terms of\n\n...\n\ncomplexity and general design 8/10 highly recommend this anime is 100% worth watching.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Johnnyjoestar33 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 24, 2024\n\nKevao51\n\nRecommended\n\n Blue Lock doesn‚Äôt redefine sports anime. Instead, it approaches the genre with a fresh perspective, focusing not on teamwork and overcoming challenges but on competition and selfishness, offering a unique take on the pursuit of greatness. While one might question how finding the most selfish striker in Japan could work, the compelling premise and well-developed characters each facing their limits and ambitions in every episode make it a captivating watch.\n\nThe characters are the core of Blue Lock. Their individual motives and backstories intertwine deftly, creating rivalries and partnerships that add nuance to the evolving plot. However, the extreme focus on ego and competition, while intriguing,\n\n...\n\nmay not meet the expectations of viewers seeking a balance between collaboration and individuality, a hallmark of traditional sports anime.\n\nThe cast is diverse and intriguing, but not all characters receive the development they deserve. Isagi is a solid protagonist, but his arc can feel predictable at times. Even so, the anime succeeds in building tension and excitement in the matches, with twists that keep the audience hooked.\n\nBlue Lock is a good anime, but it has room for improvement. It impresses with its boldness but lacks the depth and balance needed to reach its full potential. It‚Äôs worth watching, but don‚Äôt expect it to be the definitive masterpiece of the genre.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kevao51 (\n9\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 21, 2023\n\nRodriiz\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (19/24 eps)\n\n brazilian portuguese:\n\nAnime que me chamou bastante a aten√ß√£o pois gosto muito de animes e futebol, ter uma combina√ß√£o dos dois √© muito dificil, n√£o no sentido de cria√ß√£o e sim no sentido de fidelidade, a maioria dos animes de futebol sempre tem algum ‚Äúpoder unico‚Äù tirando certa imers√£o ao assistir, no blue lock n√£o √© diferente, pois √© chamado de ‚Äúarmas, quimica e etc‚Äù que seria uma especie de poder, mas o anime em si √© muito bom, acho que eles poderiam ter focado mais nas historias dos outros personagem ao inves de s√≥ mostrar um resumo da vida dele, anime excelente em quest√£o de\n\n...\n\nanima√ß√£o e desenvolvimento, o roteiro √© simples e previsivel nos poupando de ficar vendo analises em outros sites que j√° um ponto bom, e venho mostrar meus eternos sentimentos ao nosso ‚Äúrei‚Äù do futebol, Pel√©, descanse em paz. nota 8/10 porque ainda deixa a desejar em alguns quiesitos.\n\nAnie altamente recomendavel para quem est√° interesado.\n\nEnglish:\n\nAnime that caught my attention a lot because I really like anime and football, having a combination of the two is very difficult, not in the sense of creation but in the sense of fidelity, most football anime always have some ‚Äúunique power‚Äù taking away certain immersion when watching, blue lock is no different, as it is called ‚Äúweapons, chemistry and etc‚Äù which would be a kind of power, but the anime itself is very good, I think they could have focused more on the stories of others character instead of just showing a summary of his life, excellent anime in terms of animation and development, the script is simple and predictable saving us from seeing analyzes on other sites which is already a good point, and I come to show my eternal feelings to our ‚Äúking‚Äù of football, Pel√©, rest in peace. note 8/10 because it still leaves something to be desired in some aspects.\n\nhighly recommendable anime for those with an interest.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Rodriiz (\n24\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 20, 2023\n\niheartvenus\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n If I'm being completely honest, I would say that Blue lock currently is on the way to becoming a memorable anime in the sports genre. I think the animations fine (although it doesn't do the manga justice) and they do a fairly good job on the pacing as well. The characters are likeable and they're able to stand on their own without the help of other characters. I do think the tropes are a bit overdone in this like this basically another shokugeki no soma but without the boobs and the cooking (although they b cooking :ppp) and so maybe if they start building something\n\n...\n\nmore unique id give it a higher rating.

I still remember when the Japanese national team first came to my country in the 1940s, they came very peacefully. They also visited other countries to practice matches. But their achievements then faded after the match against America in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But this anime, raised my spirit again! Tatakae!!!

Let's take another look (spoiler-free so not in-depth).\n\nThe story is centered around football. Is the anime going to represent football 100% accurately? Of course not, most sports anime don't do a good enough job showcasing their respective sports. And that's not the goal of Blue Lock either. The author took football, picked and chose the aspects to keep and/or exaggerate and those to discard, and added some other elements as well. Call it what you want: creativity, adaptation... Regardless, I personally am super excited about\n\n...\n\nwatching a real football match now. I could have cared less about football prior to watching this anime to be honest. My point is that judging a sports anime based on the sport representation might turn out to be the same as judging a book by its cover, and the effects of a non-accurate showing might not be the worst either.\n\nThe Blue Lock Project gathers 300 strikers for training. This obviously does not mean that these characters' motivations and backstories aren't diverse. They're boring only if we ignore why/how it became their dream to be the best striker. Furthermore, just because they're all trying to become strikers doesn't mean that the chararcters don't respect the other positions. The necessity becomes obvious once they start playing matches, and there's nothing wrong with or disrespectful about trying to improve so they could do everything themselves as strikers. It's the whole point of the Project. \n\nThe animation is great. It pulls you in, makes you want to keep watching. I personally appreciate it because bad or mediocre animation is unfortunately the biggest deal-breaker for me, no matter how good everything else is. As for music, I was happy to hear UNISON SQUARE GARDEN sing the first OP. They did an opening for Run With the Wind, so singing for another sports anime felt fitting.\n\nThe concept itself is quite intrguing, and the claims Blue Lock as a whole makes about Japanese football and society holds at least some water. I also appreciate how concise this anime is about its main character's OPness: identify the problem and overcome it. Yes, it happens unrealistically quickly, but the character is OP nevertheless so we might as well roll with it. However, I think that anyone who watches Blue Lock can leave with some food for thought regarding the main character's improvement.\n\nWhat knocked some points off for me was how exaggerated the passion is. It doesn't feel \"sincere\", it's literally as if they become possessed. And I don't vibe with that.\n\nAll in all, watch it if you want to. The anime has a lot to offer. I hope my review was an encouragement to at least check it out and maybe give it a try.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by B-FOUR (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 28, 2023\n\nZerockman\n\nRecommended\n\n I really enjoyed Blue Lock. Even though I haven't watched a lot of sports anime, it's a genre I really like and I'm hoping to delve deeper into it from now on.\n\nThe truth is I fell in love with Blue Lock from the very first episode and the reason is simple - the concept. Blue Lock is really interesting because it's not about another sports club on the brink of disbanding that suddenly gets a new member and reaches the nationals all of a sudden. This formula works, and we've seen plenty of sports manga and anime apply it right, but just the fact that\n\n...\n\nwe get a sports anime, a sports shonen on top of that, that is not focused on a school club is a breath of fresh air. Blue Lock focuses on a group of 300 high school students that are invited to participate in a program where they will train in a facility aiming to become the best striker in Japan. All 300 of the players are forwards and this creates a very interesting dynamic you won't be expecting.\n\nProbably my favourite part about Blue Lock is all the different types of football matches they employ in the anime. In the first episode you get a game of catch with a football. Then the 1st selection has traditional 11v11 matches but none of these players have been used to any position other than forwards, so seeing them fill the gaps and start rotating in the middle of the games is really interesting. Later in the show you see 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and 5v5 matches, which is also a nice change of pace.\n\nIn a tactical aspect Blue Lock is also very interesting. Every character has a different \"weapon\". Be it jumping really high, running really fast, shooting from mid range and so on. Seeing these characters employ these weapons in the best possible scenarios, the so called \"formulas\", and evolving their weapons and becoming better players throughout the season is really nice.\n\nBlue Lock has a lot of different characters. Some you'll come to like, others not so much, but the cast is really big and there are all sorts of different personalities. Many of these characters have their own backstory brought up and you start feeling for them. Some join the program because they want to have fame, others want to be the very best and some just want to have fun. That's why when some characters get eliminated from the program you're bound to feel for them. The character designs are also really unique and it's very easy to distinguis and remember all the characters.\n\nIf I had to point out the few problems I've had with Blue Lock it's pretty simple:\n\n- the animation is quite lackluster. It's not bad by any means but it's pretty inconsistent and makes use of a lot of CGI;\n\n- there are a lot of monologues throughout the matches, these are meant to explain all the tactics and strategies the players use. But sometimes there's a lot of down time during the matches with these monologues. They work better in manga format but in anime format it's not as good;\n\n- finally there are the metaphors. This is something that started to bother me more so towards the second half of the show. It's not a deal breaker, but there are a lot of metaphors like the players having monsters inside of them, which I think is referring to their desire to become the best in football, or when Isagi deconstructs and then reconstructs himself with puzzle pieces, learning something new about himself or his opponents, or anytime they say \"devour\" in this anime that kind of pisses me off. Like I said, it's not a deal breaker at all, but sometimes it does bother me and I would just prefer that they would tone it down a little.\n\nAll in all I really like Blue Lock a lot, I would say it's one of my favourite sports anime (not that I've watched many). At one point this was a 10/10 for me but a few things here and there made me lower the score to a 9. I still think the anime is amazing and is imo a must watch for any sports anime fan.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Zerockman (\n24\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 7, 2023\n\nnate_iskm\n\nRecommended\n\n If you want to be the best, you've to prove yourself (and be a little bit selfish)\n\nThe fantasy that this anime put into football, makes sounds like something awful, but actually connects in a way that only this story could receive that.

However, inspired by the real-life disappointment that is Japanese soccer back in World Cup 2018, Blue Lock was made, and it completely middle-fingered the genre. \n\nBlue Lock is about developing ego of a striker. It‚Äôs an intense training program for the best high school strikers in Japan. Through each match, we saw how each character developed and discovered their own sense of ego. Yes the strikers had to play in teams, but the teamwork serves to elevate the scorers only. One of its hardcore theme was the more you score, the\n\n...\n\nbetter you are. \n\nTeamwork supposes to make every character better. However, Blue Lock twists this theme to a more toxic direction. It‚Äôs about devouring your teammates or opponents, meaning to adapt their skill and make it better. At the end, the one that scores leaves the other one behind. \n\nBlue Lock perfectly captured what it tried to do. It animated each character differently in terms of color of their aura and personal struggle. It always emphasized each goal showing the resolves behind each shot. I was gripping my seat at multiple sequences. \n\nOverall, Blue Lock is different from its genre, and it sure leaves a mark.

There would be no problem with this approach if it weren't for the fact that football is a TEAM game! Seriously, much of the strategies or technical aspect of it are diminished in order to support this narrative of selfish evolution. Rather than playing football in the field as a whole, it become an ego-only battle between players.\n\nOh yeah the characters... despite being an anime about self growth, there is little to no personal character development. They only\n\n...\n\ngrow in the sense that they become better players. They are all the same except for the differences in the abilities that each one has.\n\nApart from that, the animation is really good and quite astonishing at times.

There is not much going on other than a bunch of frenzied \"strikers\" throughout the whole show trying to outdo one another. Actual matches with normal players are pretty much non-existent.\n\nNext, I need to talk about the art. The eyes! Why? Why do the characters look like they are in a permanent state of shock the whole time? Also, some of those eyes gave me the heebie-jeebies more than most horror shows did. I hated how they creeped me out while watching, and it was really a major distraction.\n\nThere\n\n...\n\nis also so much internal monologue! If there isn't so much of that, I am quite sure the whole series could have been done within a twelve-episode run. It has been exhausting having to sit through a few minutes of internal monologue before almost every tiny bit of kick or pass in a sports show.\n\nThe only dramatic thing in this show is the unnecessary drama within the brains of the characters every time they see, or want to do something.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Yunice (\n16\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 31, 2022\n\nPlaugeDr\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock is the definition of dumb fun Shonen, and I love it for that. Its such a fun series to just sit back and turn your brain off to enjoy some fun characters and a plot that's simple yet intriguing enough to keep watching week to week. For those who don't know Blue Lock is about an experiment set up by the Japan Football Union to pull out top of the line players by essentially setting up a soccer survival game called Blue Lock that encourages the use of Ego in 300 of the best high school football players. The goal of this experiment\n\n...\n\nis to establish a top of the line football team to play in the World Cup. Fail however, and your Soccer career is over for good. The anime follows underdog Yoichi Isagi and his journey to climb up the ranks of Blue Lock to become the best striker in Japan. \n\nThe Plot is incredibly simple, following a formula that is simple, classic, and fun. Depending on the person you ask they might be tired of the classic Shonen formula. But in my opinion, that classic Shonen formula gives a motive for the character to chase that is simple and understandable and for people who just want to have fun, that's all you really need. Not every anime has to be a deep complex dissection of human morality or society as a whole. So the plot while simple is fun and entertaining to watch even if it can be a tad cringe every w and than. Add on a diverse cast of characters all of which have their own strengths and weaknesses, even if their backstories are similar \"I grew up watching soccer heroes and wanted to be like him\" each character feels unique and fun. My personal favorite being Chirigiri. \n\nThe animation of Blue Lock is also pretty good, nothing over the top and mind blowing like something like Demon Slayer or Fate Grand Order. But the animation and the stylistic choices used are unique and reflect the art style of the manga well. Overall if you like simple fun Shonen anime Blue Lock is something you would probably enjoy. Sure you could argue there are better Shonen to watch, but if Blue Lock has your interest, give it a shot. You might just have fun with it.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by PlaugeDr (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 13, 2022\n\nH1DR0\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (5/24 eps)\n\n The interesting premise behind Blue Lock is what incites curiosity and brings in a lot of viewers. But is it just an interesting idea with a shallow execution or a fleshed out story with well written characters?\n\nThe twist behind Blue Lock is that it focuses on creating a great attacker with a huge ego while a lot of other sport titles lean heavy on the teamwork aspect. The cast of characters presented thus far is good enough with everyone having easily differentiable personalities. The MC is written well enough and has a kinda similar to Ashito in his football sense. Studio 8bit is doing a\n\n...\n\ngreat job in the animation department and are able to create some hype moments. The pacing is good enough. It follows the same structure as other sport anime in that regard. \n\nOverall I believe that Blue Lock is a solid watch that can keep you intrigued for the most part. If the story keeps its flow and the animation stays consistent throughout its 24 episode run, the show will prove to be a very entertaining experience.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by H1DR0 (\n9\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 12, 2022\n\nThe_Weekly_Jay\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (10/24 eps)\n\n \"Blue Lock\" has been a weekly treat that is often looked forward to, which is saying something because it premiered in arguably the most stacked anime season of 2022. Shows such as \"Bleach\" making its long-awaited comeback, \"Chainsaw Man\" and its goose-bumping hype, the excitement around \"Mob Psycho 100\" season 3, and the second half of \"Spy x Family\" season 1, to name a handful, are all staking claims as THE anime to keep your eyes on. Let's remember that other shows, such as \"Gundam: The Witch From Mercury\" and \"My Hero Academia\" season 6, also premiered this season. It can be overwhelming to\n\n...\n\nsort through all the fall season's anime alone. \n\nWhile it might look like a generic sports series at first glance, Blue Lock's core themes and format make it stand out and, at times, will subvert expectations. It is NOT for everyone, which is perfectly okay. Some sports animanga enthusiasts have found the theme of \"every man for himself\" a bit jarring since most sports animanga focuses on teamwork and unity from the jump. To give better context, Blue Lock introduces us to Yoichi Isagi, a high school forward soccer player who loses his chance to go to nationals. In the heat of the moment, Isagi decided to pass to his teammate instead of taking the potential winning shot, which his teammate ultimately could not follow through with, causing Isagi's team to lose the match. The regret of this one decision is the leaping point for our main protagonist and his journey to becoming Japan's best striker. Coincidently, Japan's Football Union is looking to form a team of the best players to compete in the World Cup.\n\nThe thing is, Japan has never won a World Cup due to its passive approach to soccer. This is where Blue Lock comes in-a facility tailor-made to produce high-quality players led by the madman, Jinpachi Ego. The catch: all of these players are strikers, just like Isagi. So what do you get when you mix your favorite survival game show with soccer? You get Blue Lock. Without spoiling any essential details, Blue Lock hosts the country's top high school strikers. Teams are formed, and they must compete against one another. The last team standing will represent Japan. \n\nHow is this possible if every player is a striker? How can everyone accomplish anything if everyone has the same approach to the game? That's the point.\n\nThe series explores the ego, what it takes to be a true striker, and what makes a great player. It is a sleeper for this season with an interesting premise, a solid cast of characters, great animation, and a banging soundtrack. Due to Isagi being a high-level athlete, the series does not waste much time watching the main character go from \"no-skill to pro-level.\" He is challenged to grow in his skills, which is appreciated, especially by those who have played sports at a competitive level. Even if you don't play sports, there are some genuine moments riddled with raw emotions that, at the very least, would get your attention. (If you're like me, then you probably will scream at whichever device you use to stream out of excitement.)\n\nBlue Lock has its fair share of tropes-this show's biggest offender would be over-explaining every detail during the soccer matches. However, there is a reason for this. Therefore, it can be overlooked. Something else to note is that sometimes CGI will be used during the matches. It can feel out of place at times. Still, it does not affect the experience overall. There are also the \"Blue Lock, Additional Time\" segments after every episode that looks closely at the characters and their day-to-day activities when they are not on the field, which you will most certainly enjoy if you're into the cast. \n\nChoosing to watch weekly has benefited my experience, but you may find it easier to wait til after the season to binge in one go. Whatever you decide, know that Blue Lock is worth a watch whether you're into sports or not.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by The_Weekly_Jay (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nPrevious\n - \nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

Very fresh and unique concept at first glance but later in the story it becomes very repetitive and very cliche. It doesn't follow the underdog team wanting to reach at the top with the help of the protagonist teammates. But.. is it not though? \n\nFirst, the so called cliche, \"underdog team that want to be on top\" is just the Team Japan they want to build to win the WC in this anime. \n\nSecond, the \"teamwork, characters helping each other to improve\" do I even have to say it. It's all over the place in this anime as well.\n\nSo what makes it look\n\n...\n\ndifferent you ask? It's no other than the sudden dialogue/trash talk by the character, the magic terms that is used every episode like \"ego\", \"chemical reaction\", \"weapon\" and \"devour\" that serves like a seasoning to a dish to spice up the atmosphere (enough for teenage viewers to shiver).\n\nThis anime's story is very linear it's just follows a single path and characters with no depth. It takes the cliche \"shonen-battle fantasy formula\" and integrate it into a sport genre that is known to use the \"slice of life\" approach. \n\nTake example DBZ, a shonen-battle fantasy anime. Goku meets a new enemy gets overpowered give him a few struggle moments then he will have a comeback with a new form. Now put Isagi there, he meets a new strong player, give him a few struggle moments then he will \"evolve\" get's a new skill and then the cycle continues. CLICHE and REPETITIVE very battle-ish approach.\n\nAnyway, if that's your preference I guess I get why you like this very much. But for me as someone who watches a number of sports anime, at most Blue Lock is just average.\n\nSo for those who's planning to watch this anime, lower your expectation it will greatly help. This is one of the example of an anime that is carried mostly by hype and bandwagon (not gonna say animation, cause it's pretty disappointing).\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by kkkrrrddd (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 4, 2022\n\nOverlordBel\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (5/24 eps)\n\n It is very important that I make this one thing clear: I REALLY DISLIKE SOCCER. I grew up with all my friends around me playing it all the time, and I had to force myself to play with them just so I wouldn't feel left alone. It's not that I dislike sports in general, just that soccer is one of my least favorite ones. Even so, I never really bothered to watch any sport anime at all.\n\nWith that out of the way...BLUE LOCK IS FUCKING GREAT! I actually just picked it to watch thinking it was like a typical shounen fighting anime, and now I\n\n...\n\nfind myself getting excited for the next episodes. And I know exactly why I am enjoying this sport anime: the plot is actually unique for a sports anime, it is very well animated(so far anyway), and the way how everything is presented very dramatically like it is an actual shounen anime with cool powers and visual effects, and pretty unique cast of characters that are also very well drawn and designed.\n\nThe plot is simple but original. The protagonist is chosen to participate in some type of battle royale where only the best and most egoistic soccer player will survive. Right away that already made me interested, but other than the plot and it's presentation, I also really like more characters presented so far. Even the protagonist, who is usually basic and boring do-gooder Gary Stu, is actually a pretty inferior guy who, even if he is still a nice guy, still got that egoistic nature that makes him walk over other players to climb the top and fight against the bigger dogs that he isn't really able to handle yet. That really caught me off guard about the protagonist and it makes me wanna keep watching to see how cooler he can get.\n\nThe series is currently still airing so I have no idea if the series will keep being good, but I think regardless of the outcome, I will still enjoy it because I already know this anime is already in it's own place, and isn't just following the same old sports anime formula.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by OverlordBel (\n26\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 6, 2022\n\nMango-tan\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (5/24 eps)\n\n (review based on the 5 episodes I've seen) Right off the bat, this isn't even a sports anime really lol. It's a survival game type anime, using soccer as a sort of background concept to give blunt criticism on Japan's soccer strategy (and simultaneously judging the usual Japanese way of thinking as well). While sports anime are usually about comradery, trust, friendship, healthy rivalry, Blue Lock preaches the advantages of individualism. \n\nThis sort of novelty allows this anime to have multiple advantages/pros/good points: \n\n - It's a fresh taste in the pool of sports anime\n\n - It offers insight on collectivism vs. individualism (we find\n\n...\n\nout more about these concepts with each ep, along with the main characters)\n\n - It offers that perfect balance between using sports as an easy medium to convey concepts without making you have to become an expert in soccer or any sports for that matter (hence no lengthy explanations about the game rules)\n\n - For those who (like me) don't really like the shock value and gore themes of survival games, this anime offers the thrill and excitement of those without grossing you out\n\nAnd if that's not enough, the anime is pretty high quality to make it very enjoyable: \n\n - excellent OST that fits each moment (usually fitting for action or suspenseful scenes)\n\n - snappy and crips animation (I'd like to mention that it being a sports anime makes this even more challenging, i.e. it literally NEEDS to have good animation for fast-paced actions while allowing those actions to be well visible)\n\n - easy to follow but enjoyable story writing/pacing\n\n - superb voice acting with \"old\" well-known and newer talents as well\n\nThe only things I could offer as potential warnings or disadvantages are the sometimes unsettling facial expressions (it's really nothing bad, but not something you'd expect from your regular lil' sports anime) and maybe the lack of character depth so far (I am currently trying to compare this in my head to e.g. Kuroko's Basket where everyone has different hair colors and there's a lot of emphasis on their interpersonal relationships). If you can look past these things, I think it's definitely worth at least a try since it has a sense of novelty, and its quality is good as well.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Mango-tan (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 26, 2022\n\nJakexy\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (3/24 eps)\n\n CRINGE, EMBARRASSING, AWKWARD\n\nThe amount of cringe, embarrassment and awkwardness I feel when watching this anime is unbelievableüòÇThe worst second hand embarrassment I felt so far. \n\nThe dialogues are killing me! HAHAHAHAHAHA They are talking with the demons inside them literally, face to face lol. And they want to kill each other just for the title 'the greatest strikerüòÇ\" It's so childish really. It's like hundreds of grown-ups fighting for a single candy offered by an old man they met along the street (yes that old man is ego)\n\nAnd the way they keep mentioning the 3 real life football players over and over again, in the\n\n...\n\nsame order and the same manner is so funny and cringe worthy. Instead of feeling proud that famous forwards are getting mentioned, I feel embarrassed instead like what the heck. \n\nThe premise and basically the plot of this anime is \"TO BE THE GREATEST STRIKER IN THE WORLD\" Lol striker here, striker there. Does football only has strikers as position? Idk but it sounds corny af. \n\nThe story and the characters doesn't have the inspirational impact like with Haikyuu. Characters in blue lock felt like robots programmed with only one mission. I can't feel anything special for them, I can't feel the pull and the need to support them like what I normally feel with sports anime characters... I just watch them and sometimes say, \"Oh wow he's gorgeous\" but that's it. It's like being attracted only with the looks. \n\nOn the other hand, they do said blue lock is not made to be inspirational and relatable. It's not made to be realistic. Well too bad though because that's what I'm looking for in sports animes. Being realistic, inspirational and relatable are the greatest feelings a sports anime can provide to it's audience. Emotional impact is better than just \"hype\". \n\nAnimation is good, that why many people are hyped about it. But Haikyuu's animation is still way better and way cleaner. Sometimes blue lock is like a slide show of events.\n\nMusic is fine. Nothing amazing. \n\nOverall (2): I didn't enjoy it much because like I said, the cringe is unbearable. I wanna smack in them in the face for saying idiotic and corny stuffs everytime. it's not for me.\n\nSummary: \n\n‚úìBlue lock world revolves on strikers alone. So if you're waiting for other positions to appear, don't bother. \n\n‚úìDialogues are cringe af and bad af.\n\n‚úìCharacters are not that interesting. But they do have gayness vibe in them when they're looking at each other so if you're a shipper that's a plus. \n\n‚úì Trying hard to be edgy. It's almost stupid.\n\nIf you still wanna watch it after all I said, go ahead. To see is to believe anyway.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Jakexy (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 22, 2023\n\nArturiaP3ndrag0n\n\nRecommended\n\n Alright, the show is finished so I can say the full story now. It is great to see a lot of people see the light and it shows in the reviews. \n\nTl;dr; 8/10 = For those who can enjoy it, this anime is a very entertaining and refreshing take on the football anime landscape full of interesting characters and growth in the backdrop of an ideologically charged character who believes Japanese Football requires Ego to grow and allow them to compete for the World Cup. Full of hype moments and exhilarating sequences that are incredibly fun to watch.\n\nArtistic and Fun: 2/2\n\nIt is fun to watch\n\n...\n\nthe craziness that unfolds on the pitch, it is quite entertaining in how the match progresses and the artistic merit of inducing ego within players is well founded.\n\nRecommended: 1/2\n\nI can easily recommend Blue Lock to everyone, both the anime and the manga are a really good read. For people who watch actual football, I can understand they will find this cringe and jarring that is just how anime is. The focus of the anime is on developing egos and how the character chemistry works with other Egoists, it is less about tactics, structure and mechanics surrounding the beautiful game. If that is what you want to look at, you are welcome to watch other football centric shows like Ao Ashi but this one laser focuses on the Egoism and it does its job perfectly but I can understand that it will not be entertaining and even frustrating for some people but for those who can enjoy it it is a top tier treat.\n\nNarrative Consistency: 2/2\n\nMade simple, if you ask your self 3 questions ‚ÄúWhy are we here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere are we headed?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow are we gonna get there‚Äù If you are able to get a satisfactory answer for those 3 questions then that is good narrative consistency. ‚ÄúWe are looking for the One Piece, that is why we are headed to the Grand Line but it is the pirates graveyard so we figure out a way to cross it from this guy Koby who explains how marines cross it‚Äù sounds good? A good anime has sound narrative consistency. Blue Lock, depending on who you ask, has an answer to those questions but each in their own way. For Ego ‚ÄúJapanese Football needs Ego, For that I made Blue Lock to cultivate their Ego. How that is gonna happen is through elimination so only the strongest egoists survive‚Äù, For Isagi ‚ÄúI want to play football on a high level maybe even the world cup, That is why I am at Blue Lock and why I am going to be the greatest striker. I do that by analysing, deconstructing and remaking myself to overcome my enemies‚Äù. You get the point, every character can answer that very well which is a very strong case for how good the narrative consistency is. On top of that, their reasons are compelling and get you invested.\n\nEmotional Highs: 2/2\n\nDefined as moments that evoke strong emotion, be it Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Laughter or even Thought Provoking that can leave you speechless. United States of Smash, the unveiling of the master plan in FMAB and Okabe's Operation Arclight are good examples.\n\nMinimum 3 moments = 2 points\n\nBlue Lock has plenty of hype moments, from Isagi‚Äôs Direct Shot, to the Back Heel and how he overcomes Barou. That is Isagi alone, Bachira, my beloved Chigiri and Nagi all of them have their moments.\n\nBias: 1/2\n\nIll mention it briefly, my biases are: Idealogue, Theme of Kingship, History\n\nBlue Lock has the idealogue of Ego down to a Tee, so it gets the point for that. Also there are plenty of Historical inspirations like Messi, Cantona and Ronaldo. For manga readers they will know in the later chapters how we have leagues and how players are inspired from actual people. However I cannot give it the point for Theme of Kingship which is my favourite, Barou briefly explored the idea of a King which quickly becomes about a Tyrant and for the manga readers they will know its more than that. Therefore, it is unfair but Biases are subjective and I find the Theme of Kingship to be the most worthwhile theme to discuss as it embodies Strength, Sincerity and Duty in a character while also as the political system that has prevailed the longest in human history. Therefore 2/3 bases means 1 point.\n\nConclusion: 8/10\n\nThis anime is a very entertaining and full of hype as well as great art with the sound track, colors and animation. It breaks the usual mold of how football really is of the power of friendship sort, and for those finding it to be surface level or cringe haven't understood the point of the story. It's not Strikers are everything or All Strikers only. Football doesn't work like that; the idea is to induce Ego as that is what Jinpachi Ego believes is what is missing in Japans football and through is Ego every player finds what they are good at and use that to the full extent while still being hungry for the ball. The character dynamics, the growth of every character, their personal motivations and chemistry is a joy to watch. Most specifically the way Isagi breaks himself down and rebuilds himself again to overcome each challenge is one of the most interesting displays of dealing with obstacles.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ArturiaP3ndrag0n (\n19\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 4, 2023\n\nSSJ-SUP3RM4N\n\nRecommended\n\n Many see Blue Lock as the next big dog of sports animanga. Though the golden age of the sports genre has come and gone, especially with Haikyuu end's in sight, this entry strives to keep the genre alive and assert itself as a top title in the genre. \n\nThe main gist here, to put it simply, is battle shonen soccer. Each character has different 'powers' that correlate to their main skill as a player. These powers can be simple traits, such as being abnormally fast or strong, or more specific to a particular style of play, like getting to a sweet spot for a long-range\n\n...\n\nshot on goal or having a go-to specific type of move on the ball. A lot of the on-pitch play involves how players' powers present themselves and mesh with those of their teammates and clash against those of their opponents. From the immediate onset, it is clear that this show does not give a single damn about being accurate to soccer. The main preface, which only acknowledges 1 out of many player positions in soccer, can almost be interpreted as disrespectful to the sport. It is true that scoring goals is how to win and many of the best players in the world are known for quality goal scoring, but there's more to the tactics and strategy of soccer than a one-man show of putting the ball in the net. This anime is very daring in that it basically says 'to hell with all of that', making the striker the be-all, end-all. It is understandable how this could be a turn-off for more hardcore soccer fans, as seeing soccer presented this way can be very jarring. Depending on your taste, however, it can be easy to appreciate just how differently the sport is approached here. At the surface, a team sport is turned into an individual death match on a race to the top, but over time, a core theme of this anime is a deeper aspect of that preface. As an athlete, balancing ego versus being part of a team is a dilemma that real athletes have to confront in real team sports at every level. Much of the narrative centers around how the characters use their skills and experience to find their own rationale and reasoning towards that balance, if they even choose to see it as a balance at all, and act on their findings on the pitch. Though the main plot here is as crazy as they come for a sports anime, it is clear that the creator actually knew their stuff. Many real tactics are used in matches, and if anything, are actually over-explained. In addition, some conversations characters have make references to soccer culture and even to real-life players and events. Outside of that, almost all of modern soccer convention is thrown out the door right at the start. All of that said, this is anime, where every little subject or action can easily be over-exaggerated. Staying true to real-life is no guarantee in this medium whatsoever regardless of genre. \n\nPresence or absence of realism aside, this story suffers from two significant flaws. The first and more severe is that at too many times, it is hard to really lock in during matches as a viewer. At their best, matches are dynamic and exciting. Shots on goal are epic and momentum changes, while at an overall faster pace, are not too unlike those seen in real life matches. That said, problems quickly start to arise when players are visualizing strategies in their heads. Though that in itself is not an issue, what is an issue is that time crawls to a standstill during these monologues. They usually stem from over-explanation of tactics and/or the odd need to give every moment on the pitch an overly lengthy reaction. The match may as well be stopped while we hear the characters think and they don't exactly think in a hurry either. It becomes disruptive and especially in some of the more significant matches, gets quite annoying. Even more baffling is that there are actually times where players did strategize on the move, like in real life. The second not-as-much-but-still major problem is that there were a few too many points where the story is too predictable, most of them being in the first cour. The fact that soccer matches only have three possible outcomes, a win, loss, or draw, is an inherent disadvantage, made worse by there being times where a draw is not even applicable. This is not a blanket issue by any means though. There are still many times where this show excites and keeps you guessing, and there are more ways an on-field product is shown apart from traditional 11v11 matches. This issue more so manifests at specific points where the story is pushed into a corner after a certain event goes a certain way. In these cases, the circumstances playing out make it so that there is only one or a few perceivable ways that the following events can actually go without drastically altering the story. If this story early on gave off more of an impression of willing to make those drastic changes, this would likely be less of an issue, but that tone is never really set.\n\nIn terms of characters, there are a lot of them. Though not obvious at first glance, there is actually a decent variety to the main cast, both in mannerism and personality. Care is taken to ensure that there is an understanding for each character's reason for being in the story and their exact rationales on how they approach the events of the story. For how many characters there are, it is impressive the depth many of them have. Not every character is going to have an epic tale of a backstory, though some will get closer to that than others. Some characters have very simple reasons for their actions and reasoning, some of which are more believable and/or relatable than others. Either way, most of the characters that get a significant amount of screen time, even some more minor ones, get just the right amount of development and backstory. Spreading it out like done here is no easy feat, but credit is due for getting it right here. The only real issue is that sometimes that development comes in the middle of a match, further exacerbating the problem of matches too often lacking coherence.\n\nThe main character here, Yoichi Isagi, is another flavor of the typical shonen MC archetype, though that is not necessarily a bad thing. His personality is not necessarily unique or striking but his development is satisfying. He is a bit dense, but also reliable and usually comes through when he needs to in the big moments. His design is much less colorful and distinct than those of his counterparts, though it doesn't look particularly bad. He has the appearance of a small fish in a big pond, but in reality, he's right up there with the rest of them. His 'power' is a unique trait even in terms of actual soccer, and how he becomes more in-tune with it over time and gains confidence in his skill set as a result is good to see. \n\nAs varied as the characters are, the voices do not have as much variance. The cast is almost entirely male, with only one recurring female character, one factor as to why there isn't as much variety in this regard. There are some familiar veteran names (e.g. Nobunaga Shimazaki, Kouki Uchiyama, Hiroshi Kamiya) but many of the main characters will be voices unfamiliar to many. For how many fresh, new names there are to the cast, the voice acting is quality. Among the newer names, Kazuki Ura's performance as Yoichi Isagi is particularly impressive, as he does a great job expressing the nuances in Yoichi's changes in attitude and mindset as the series progresses. The OPs and EDs are all solid and the mostly-electronic OST is nothing worth a snuff at. \n\nVisually, this show is certainly one of the better-looking for 2022. The fidelity and detail are high. The use of color is in a sweet spot, as the colors are all very vibrant, but there is never a feeling of over-saturation. The cherry on top are some very unique visual effects with their own sense of color and pop that help give this show its unique sense of style. These effects are usually saved for the most pivotal of moments, only serving to heighten the urgency and impact in those sequences. The approach with the character design, like with how they were written, is clearly a quantity over quality approach. None of the designs are too intricate but there is a pleasant consistency in their color, fidelity, and impact. It is likely that though you may forget a character's name, you may remember them easily based off of how they look. In a show like in this one with many characters to juggle, this effect is welcome. \n\nThe quality of play on the pitch is good at most times, but did also suffer at certain points. The aforementioned issue of inner monologues disrupting the flow of matches is the only true negative in this aspect, but can be a very big negative at times. There is some CGI sprinkled here and there but it is usually only used when showing teams running up and down the pitch and it is hardly seen in big moments of the match (sometimes, still shots are used in those big moments but these look good most of the time). Given the inherent high level of skill many of the characters have in the story, many of the moves they make on the ball are visually stunning and pleasing. Many high-skill techniques, such as back heel shots, one touch high through passes, and scorpion kicks, can be found in this show and contribute a lot to the excitement in the on-pitch play. Overall, it does not feel too much like actual soccer with all of the shonen-like 'powers' and the overall wackiness of the main premise but it comes pretty close. \n\nThough the oddly-paced and predictable story may turn this show into a slog for some, there's a lot to gain from the physical watching experience. The art style itself is high-quality, packed with color, and has a lot of unique effects. Though the number of characters to keep up with can be a bit much at first, this show gets it right with appropriate development and memorable interactions. Don't be fooled by the soccer motif. Soccer may be what makes you come to this show, but it may or may not be what makes you stay, considering how different it is from actual soccer. If you like battle shonen but want to experience it in a new and creative way that goes past the typical action motifs, chances are you will really like what this show has to offer.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SSJ-SUP3RM4N (\n12\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 26, 2025\n\nBatmankoji\n\nRecommended\n\n I started this show in 2023, I felt it was mildly interesting for the first four episodes, with the new concept of egoism while playing football catching my attention as I was a football player myself.

I can say I was blown away.\n\nBlue Lock is a sports anime centered around the concept of a specialized training program designed to create the ultimate striker for the Japanese national soccer team. The story follows a group of talented young forwards who are selected to participate in the blue lock program, where they compete against each other to become the chosen striker to lead Japan to victory.\n\nOne of the standout aspects of \"Blue lock\" is its intense focus on soccer training, tactics,\n\n...\n\nand competition. The anime does a great job of immersing viewers in the world of professional soccer, and drive of the characters as they push themselves to their limits in pursuit of greatness.\n\nThe animation in \"blue Lock\" is well-executed, especially during the soccer matches, where the fast-paced action and strategic gameplay are brought to life on screen. The character designs are distinct and memorable, each player having their own unique strengths, weaknesses, and motivations that add depth to the story. \n\nThe series effectively captures the competitive spirit of sports and explores themes of teamwork, rivalry, and self-improvement. The character development is engaging, as viewers get to witness the growth and evolution of the players as they face challenges and strive to become better athletes.\n\nOverall, \"Blue Lock\" is a compelling sports anime that will appeal to fans of soccer and competitive sports. I would compare it to Kuroko basketball. With its intense matches, well- developed characters, and themes of perseverance and teamwork, the show offers a immersive viewing experience. Whether you're a sports enthusiast or simply enjoy a good underdog story, \"Blue Lock\" is definitely worth a watch.\n\nYT- Iseking IG- Whoateddi\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by WhoaTeddi (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 22, 2023\n\nKardlonoc\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (4/24 eps)\n\n A very good sports anime in concept, but it didn't quite keep my interest. It hits all the very interesting notes of a sports anime however a sports anime generally needs a unique concept to fully grasp my attention and not tropes. Blue Lock is very generic as an overall sort of sports anime. It has some very interesting ideas with the plot, but it just could not bear my attention or care long enough. I can pretty much determine all the plot points by the first couple of episodes, and I truly think nothing would surprise me, nor would I care about it. Perhaps\n\n...\n\nbecause the competition itself, based on a battle royale/death games/ squid games that are in fashion, is very low stakes. I might be interested in the masterminds stories and the odd aces, but really no, there are better things out there. I get if someone would find this fantastic, but while I like soccer its not a game I truly adore. Boxing, for instance, I could thoroughly get into and was fascinated about, which made Hajime Ippo great. \n\nIf you are looking for the next best sports anime this is definitely worth a watch.

In order to succeed in BLUE LOCK you have to be the ultra egoist player that can devour others to be the best striker in the world! In order to become the best striker in the world, the chosen players has to go through rigorous, deadly trainings and matches. Just one wrong step and you would be disqualified and say good bye to the chance of ever playing for a pro league! Your BLUE LOCK teammates will be either your comrade, your\n\n...\n\nenemy, or your rival depending on the situation. Aren't you curious about this unique sports anime? Why not give it a go if it piques your interest? I'm sure you won't be disappointed!\n\nIt was honestly very refreshing and very fun watch. I loved it so much, I just had to go and read the manga until the latest chapters.(chapter 200+) I stayed up all night and slept in the morning just to finish it.

While the animation is lacking or lazy at many points (and the CGI is far from subtle), many of the epic moments do not fail to be epic. I also hear that the manga hits different, but I'm no manga reader at this point in my life, so I have no idea. \n\nThis was a great anime to look forward to each week despite my high standards after watching Haikyuu. These two animes have definitely piqued my interest in the sports genre now, Haikyuu going so far as to\n\n...\n\nmake me learn club volleyball. I might look into soccer now, though Haikyuu definitely focused on a more realistic approach to its sport.\n\nBL is 9.2/10 for me, the main problems being how visible the animation budget cuts are to me, some of the greatest moments having notably lazy decisions. The puzzle piece trope is also overused at a few points, but it's whatever. Also (SPOILER) the attempts at English speaking from the Japanese voice actors were genuinely TERRIBLE, putting a damper on the last two episodes. Awesome ending though, season 2 sounds even more hype.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SpectreHub (\n43\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2024\n\nLemonadeSamurai\n\nRecommended\n\n BlueLock is a gem. \n\nBluelock is the story of 300 (slightly femboy) soccer players (who are all strikers) put into a building and in the end only 1 can prevail to play for Japan's national team. And if they don't make the cut they're out. For good. \n\nOur main character is a boy named Yoichi Isigai who wants to surpass his limits and become the best. \n\nIm just going to clairify before we continue in case you're lost. This is a sports Shonen. If you don't like Soccer or sports just stop reading . \n\nLike soccer? Or a little bit interested? Let's continue! \n\nThe show\n\n...\n\nstarts off with an elimination challenge in a room of 12. Then from there the 11 players compete against other teams of 11 until 3 teams remain. Then more stuff happens I won't spoil. \n\nSOME of our characters are: \n\nIsigai: Our protagonist who looks like a femboy but secretly has that dawg in him \n\nJinpachi Ego: The creator of the BlueLock program who lives on a diet of Ramen noodles with mayo with chili flakes.¬† incredibly intelligent and ruthless. \n\nChigiri: the most feminine character on the show who is extremely fast. One look at him and you'll question your sexuality. Seriously, I actually thought he was a woman at first. \n\nBarichra: a slightly femboy weirdo who claims to have a monster inside him and likes walking around naked. Very good at dribbling. \n\nBarou: The \"king\" who is the best waifu and I truly feel sorry for whomever drew him in a maid's outfit. Incredibly aggressive and talented player however. \n\nNagi: a Killua or Nagito lookalike/clone. He's always bored and sleepy but is incredibly talented with a soccer ball. He is so lazy that he even hates chewing food. \n\nIkki: a genius strategist who looks like he belongs in a Hentai given how we never see his eyes and how timid he is. \n\nKuon: Trash. \n\nThere's other characters but I don't want to spoil the cast. \n\nSo why should you watch this anime? It's full of drama and suspense. Like there's betrayal and their entire careers are on the line. They literally live in a prison like setting and are forced to pick sides. \n\nIf I had to compare this anime to others I would say its VERY similar to Rainbow Nisha or even Danganronpa. \n\nI couldn't stop watching this show. I binged it. The sheer amount of suspense and cliffhangers kept me going. \n\nNow I will admit, I like soccer. I'm not a huge fan who watches it daily but I casually enjoy it. I don't know much about it. \n\nThis show however was just fantastic to watch. It's hard to describe why but just watching the teams duke it out and seeing who gets eliminated was very exciting to behold. \n\nThe sub is how I watched it and the voices were really well done. I can't speak for the dub. \n\nThe animation is BEAUTIFUL. It's very fluid and there's moments where it just goes crazy. Theres also some 3D transitions but they're so quick you don't even notice. \n\nI really recommend BlueLock if you're even a little bit interested in sports or soccer. And if you're not..maybe give it a try anyway? It isn't boring at all. It's over the top action and thrilling. \n\nI really enjoyed BlueLock and I hope you will too.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by LemonadeSamurai (\n46\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 1, 2023\n\nMazukoChan\n\nRecommended\n\n A show about a person striving to be as egotistical as possible in a teamwork game.

I tried watching Haikyuu, but it was PERSONALLY boring to me because their plot is basically like a regular sports show but with more adorable characters and fun personalities and such. It's not bad, but I wouldn't pick to watch sport anime anymore because it is not my thing. However, Blue Lock's plot is so much more than just a sport anime (I am sorry if you say Haikyuu also is more than just a sport anime because I dropped it after the first few episodes so I have no clue what happens later).\n\n...\n\nBlue Lock has the concept of competing with others who have the same dream as you. Their ideology sounds easy, but it is not just about becoming better and winning. Blue Lock is about the process of every individuals' growth; the sympathies you give to others then they might not be happy and choose to flip you off; or the conflict you face when an idea to betray your own team and gain your power with crooked pathways creeps into your head but you also need to prevent your own reputation from being ruined at the same time; and so much more. You will feel the conflictive and objective opinions of YOURSELF'S when you watch Blue Lock. You would argue to yourself about whether the characters are doing the right thing or not. If they did anything that only 'antagonists' do, you would think to yourself, they are doing it for themselves. They are out here to compete. They are just trying to survive. This is how the true society looks like, folks. On the other hand, you would think \"hey how dare he doesn't he have a heart?! That's not fair to the others! They should play it fair!\" Well that is how the society is right now. Nothing can change it when we cannot be the \"everyone's friend\" as you put yourself as your first priority. It is hard to trust others when you're an individual out there. The niceness can be fake. Then there goes friendship. Because everyone is under the pressure of 'trust issue', they always need to remind themselves that they are alone fighting for the championship. They cannot just fight alone. What they need, is competitors who are willing to verse with you, make yourself show your flaws so you can work on them better. They live in a weird dormitory together, their social life should be healthy as they all are human. Make friends with your enemies, because they make you stronger, they stay by your side and they support you as you support them too. They should have a great value on their friendships because it is like fuel which boosts their energy up. Basically, the ideology is very conflicting. I always argue with myself when watching Blue Lock. It is a fun experience and you can actually learn some lessons from what you digest by yourself. \n\nNow up to the visual bit. It is awesome. Period. The CGI is really smooth and high-qualitied as if the creators have put their hardest work on (aside from their drone perspective goofy runs lol). I love the colour palette of Blue Lock; the hair colours are not overdramatic, and the iconic blue shirts just look right on them. Makes me want to cosplay as one of them (I have a similar hairstyle and hair colour of bachira hehe). They show you some funny outro clips that are not reallyy neccesary to the plot, but shows the fun personality or subplots which I think are wholesome. \n\nIn conclusion. It's close to be called as a masterpiece in my opinion. Watch it when it's not too late to.

The budget of the production team does not seem to be sufficient, resulting in many parts not being presented decently. \n\nIn layman's terms, when a character speaks a lot but there is not enough animation performance on the screen to support it, the audience might have a feeling of incongruity.

This paragraph is an addition to my review since I read other review seeing this as a bad anime, as I say the anime isn't perfect I admitted that some dialogue is awkward and even cringe, but that's anime for you. Read a synopsis of this anime is pretty good start if you want, I don't read it but still enjoyed the anime. I watched plenty of sport anime, Kuroko no Basket, Haikyuu, Yowamushi Pedal, Giant Killing(another football anime) to name a few, I read Slam Dunk and played\n\n...\n\nbasketball myself, still I stand on my statement on top of this review.\n\nOk, cut the point, I just wanna put it there that I was gonna give this anime 7 in rating, up until I watched episode 12 and 13(second stage in anime). \n\nThen I give this an 8 in rating, I guess people ain't wrong since this anime has 8+ rating currently.\n\nWhat take it that I give this an 8 is because they really up it up a notch the plot, episode 12 and 13 kept you engaging after first stage of the anime and I want to see more episode of this.\n\nI don't know how many episode the first season is gonna be, from what I see on this website it's gonna be 24 episodes, I hope.\n\nThey really did this anime a good job, from the writing and the animation itself is pretty great.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ValuableScent (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 11, 2023\n\nhich4n_\n\nRecommended\n\n Fucking amazing anime.\n\nThe writer is a genius.\n\nThe illustrator is a genius.\n\nThe composer is a genius.\n\nThe animators are geniuses.\n\nThe VAs are geniuses.\n\nA great example of everything that an anime should be.\n\n...\n\nPremise, story, stakes, action, feelings, characters, emotions, wit, explosiveness, ridiculousness, outrageousness, surprise.\n\nEvery episode leaving you wanting more, every episode hyping you up.\n\nThis work of art is downright INSPIRATIONAL.\n\nOne of the greatest anime I've ever seen.\n\nIt is so good, once started, I couldn't stop thinking about it and had to finish it before watching anything else.\n\nThis is one of those works that show you how great anime can be and suddenly all the trash you've watched in the past doesn't matter, as you've found a new love to brighten your path moving forward onto new anime to watch and discover.\n\nThanks to everyone involved!

Usually I like learning about characters other than the lead, but by god are the side characters in Blue Lock so damn annoying. One's a co-dependent weirdo who's more focused on revenge than anything else, one's a self-absorbed jerkoff, one's the silent but deadly type who only talks about one thing... This would be fine if these traits weren't their entire personalities. The only well-rounded character in this anime is the main guy, but sometimes it feels like he's so unremarkable that the only reason he's gotten this far\n\n...\n\nis because he pulled some crazy trick out of his ass. At first I didn't mind this aspect of the story, but it happens over and over and OVER!

Like with slice of life and drama shounen (such as Bakuman), sports shounen have a\n\n...\n\ntendency to become worse and worse as time passes. That is because these manga will keep escalating conflicts and challenges as if they were Dragon Ball, but without a world to save or actual lives being risked, all stakes start sounding artificial waaay faster than in battle manga.\n\nIn Blue Lock, however, the situation these characters are in is already kinda crazy from the start, and their goal isn't really to win some silly high school championship, but to improve themselves until they become better than even professional, world-level players. The stakes are high, and the first selection tells us, the audience, that the only people staying are at least a little bit crazy, so we are to expect all kinds of interesting shenanigans, instead of played-out high school drama (that is way better done in actual drama anime, instead of sports anime).\n\nSo yeah, I highly recommend this fun, well animated and hype-driven battle anime, disguised as a sports anime, to anyone who enjoys the thrills of competition.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by JusteMonique (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 5, 2024\n\ndatabercuse\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n TLDR: The show is fine. If you like typical shounen power fantasy or if you like isekai you'll probably find this fun. There's nothing inherently wrong with the show I just wish it wasn't such a typical predictable edgy shounen power fantasy. Ultimately this is less of a sports show and more of a shounen battle show flavored as a soccer show. \n\nThe animation is by far the best part a lot of effort was put into it and it looks amazing. It by far carries the show during its action segments. If you like the show this is probably one of the main reasons\n\n...\n\nwhy it looks amazing.\n\nThe story is just so incredibly disappointing. It ultimately has nothing new to say. Everything it mentions about ego or what it takes to be a striker is just edge bait to make the viewer feel empowered through their para-social link with the characters. The actual plot is far far far closer to something like The Berserk of Gluttony than an actual sports show. It is genuinely like someone took an edgy isekai plotline and inserted it into a show about soccer. Each character has some unique super power (because of course they do its a fkin shounen sports anime) and games ultimately come down to bullshit plot contrivances.\n\nYes the show is incredibly overrated. It is essentially just another hyperconsumable isekai but with a genuinely unique setup and great animation. However, that setup wears thin after a couple episodes and (personally) animation is not enough to carry a show. It is enjoyable trashy fun but that's it. The ultimate crime of this show is just how typical, forgettable, and unoriginal its plot is.\n\n5/10\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by databercuse (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 5, 2023\n\nPandoraHurts\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n \"Wooooosh!\" The enemy scores a goal in gym class and we lose the game. Wow, we're such a failure to Blue Lock. \n\nThis anime is fun to watch and reference around! And honestly, even though it's not a masterpiece and nothing really made sense to me (Like, is it trying to encourage us to focus on team plays or selfish plays?), it's a good sports anime to binge. After all, there aren't many soccer animes, and this anime is also quite dystopian/sci-fi.\n\nStory ~ 7: The story is pretty straightforward. You're getting what you expect: Good soccer players competing and training against each other to play\n\n...\n\nfor Japan's national team. Also, they tell us that only one can survive. But...that never made sense to me because the national team can't just have one player. Perhaps that's just the organizer trying to motivate the players.\n\nCharacters ~ 8: The characters are cool. Ily Bachira and Chigiri <3. I will say that the main character is a bit annoying since he monologues in his brain so much, but he does make the other characters shine. And his spatial awareness is interesting but it's hard to see his appeal among the other players.\n\nArt ~ 10: The art is pretty and it makes Chigiri look flawless~\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by PandoraHurts (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 7, 2023\n\npennyroyal_tea\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (21/24 eps)\n\n Just finished the 21st episode so I thought \"Hey, why don't I drop my thoughts on this series?\". Sooo, here I am.\n\nFor starters, you should know Blue Lock is a series that primarily surrounds football/soccer (thank you America). Blue Lock is basically a project that is carried out, picking the top players around Japan to go head-to-head and see who the best \"striker\" is so that they can bring victory at The World Cup.\n\nAs a person who is newly finding their interest in sports anime, Blue Lock really did catch my eye when it came out last year and I've been watching it weekly since.\n\n...\n\nYou know those series that leave you crying and brawling for the next episode? Blue Lock definitely is one of those for me. It keeps me at the edge of my seat and just really engrossed in all the pace of the episode.\n\nIn terms of animation, I'm pretty impressed. I do admit some of the motion during the matches makes it hilariously obvious that it is CGI, but I didn't mind it, there so much to love and enjoy about the art style and depiction of certain scenes. (I'll shut up here or else I'll have to mark this as a spoiler LOL)\n\nThe characters are pretty neat too. They are really memorable and have some very significant character traits. \n\nAs I said, I've been watching this since the day of release and being the human that I am, I kept peeking into how my fellow watchers felt about the series and I have some justifications to make.\n\nI've seen a lot of reviews criticizing Blue Lock for being \"unrealistic\" and \"having no relation to actual soccer\". Okay hear me out. Blue Lock IS an anime that surrounds football/soccer, but it's far from what you'd call a stereotypical \"sports anime\". It's more of a shounen, and if I were to detail the demographic, I'd label it shounen before I'd call it a sports anime.\n\nAnd being a shounen, of course it's going to have it's own creative license on the way football/soccer is played. I mean, it's still the same sport but depicted in a more shounen-y way. To be extremely precise, this is not your typical sports anime where ‚Äúteamwork is dreamwork‚Äù. Ha ha nope! It‚Äôs more about being THE Top G on the field.\n\nAnd some ideologies like the whole \"ego\" and \"inner monster\" thing have been a subject to mass scrutiny by people, calling it \"cringe\" and \"unrealistic\" in soccer. Okay so when was shounen anime ever realistic??? Go easy on it sugar cakes . \\(Ôø£Ô∏∂Ôø£*\\))\n\nSo if you are here to watch Blue Lock and strictly here to watch because you expect it to be a Football Match you watch on TV, then I doubt this series is for you my friend.\n\nNonetheless, Blue Lock is a very enjoyable series and leaves you very entertained. It's fun to be zoned out in the game and see how characters think on their feet and act fast and well... just be characters in a shounen anime series. I'm not really into football but I had a great time watching this series and watch players fight for the ball and have revelations. I am dying to check the manga out.\n\nIt's all good fun, stop taking it so seriously~\n\nDefinitely recommend you see this. A good one for the beginners. \n\nHope that was helpful\n\n~Peace!\n\n(PS. I BELIEVE IN BACHIRA SUPREMACY!!)\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by pennyroyal_tea (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 26, 2022\n\nhauntedhomes\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (12/24 eps)\n\n All of the reviews calling this \"fujoshi-bait,\" cringe, and try-hard-edgy make my blood fucking boil on so many levels...fujoshis will ship a fucking table and a chair so please do not give them that much credit for ruining your experience. \n\nThis isn't an anime about football, so if you're looking for football, go watch a football game instead. Viewing it as a typical sports anime and comparing it to other sports anime will not make the most out of what this series has to offer. Take it completely as it is, on its own--independent from other media--and that'll make this anime much more worth\n\n...\n\nyour while. \n\nI will preface this with the fact that I don't usually watch sports anime, let alone any sports at all. If it does not thrill me I will simply not push through with it. By \"thrill\" I mean that it compels me to see what will happen next--even if the ending is predictable, even if I've seen spoilers, even if I already know what will happen. A good story keeps me thinking about it even when I know everything already, because that means there's more to it than what's on the surface. A good story will just keep unraveling, and Blue Lock does that. \n\nBlue Lock's premise is so incredibly simple--yet that simplistic idea is what keeps being pushed to its limits, most notably through each character's fundamental drives. It mechanizes itself through a loose conception of Freudian/Jungian psychology (I'd say more Jungian but I don't wanna geek out on a MAL review of all things). Blue Lock is an exploration of the \"Ego\" or the \"I\" -- that full conception of who the \"self\" is and how to grasp it. It's not simply a metaphor but an allegory for what exactly makes us think life is worth living. \n\nBlue Lock is not about football, it's about the ego. It hinges on that very idea, creating a story completely full of itself and that tries so hard to be exactly what it wants to be. And I'd much rather a story that tries hard than one that doesn't try at all. \n\nNeither the anime nor the manga have ended yet so I can't say for sure what I would rate it, but for now I would give it an overall 8/10. Watch it for its compelling character development and well-constructed narrative themes--something that is always in a good shounen anime.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by hauntedhomes (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nmoooop\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n It is a fine anime about football set in a do-or-die scenario. The characters themselves are not as interesting as any other character type that you've watched. I will say though I do love Kunigami as my daddy and will not like him in the later seasons. Anyways, I liked the concept of the show which is about individual skills and talents to other sports animes which are about teamwork and friendship. I don't mind the whole egoist thing as much, I could see it being cringe, but what would be the alternative for it? Heart?\n\nIsagi the main character is pretty average just generally a\n\n...\n\nweak MC that learns and levels up as he plays more matches. I do think the sound or music was ok, it was good at moments and eh at times. OP with judgment song is pretty fire though ngl. Ok, animation I think it was really strong in the first 13 ish episodes. Then kind of went downhill where it's not terrible but, it's just eh ok. \n\nThere was something in the first 12 episodes that sent goosebumps when critical moments occurred and then not been the same since then. \n\nOverall, Blue Lock is a fine anime with generic character types and an MC that levels up in each battle with some impressive moments. But, as you go into later episodes it falls flat in terms of enjoyment. I am hoping the U-20 Arc will be better but, I don't see it happening.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by moooop (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 26, 2023\n\nMrNickLower\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (16/24 eps)\n\n O anime at√© que e bom, a anima√ß√£o e boa a hist√≥ria at√© que e boa, os personagens s√£o bons, a proposta do anime em s√≠ e boa que n√£o da pra vencer o jogo sem jogar em equipe, tem uns furos ali e aqui mas at√© que e bom, cada um tem seu estilo suas caracter√≠sticas.\n\nThe anime is good, the animation is good, the story is good, the characters are good, the proposal of the anime itself is good that you can't win the game without playing as a team, there are some holes there and here but until it's good, each one has\n\n...\n\nits style its characteristics.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MrNickLower (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 11, 2023\n\nrmkline\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (18/24 eps)\n\n This is one of the most unique soccer animes to date but as good as it is, it drops off in quality in the second half\n\nBlue lock is such a fascinating concept and in addition to its solid writing and story, it is no wonder that it is one of the most popular anime of the season. The very first episode drags you into the world and makes you realize that this anime isn't going to be about friendship and teamwork, this is about becoming the greatest egotistic striker in the world. When we get introduced to our main character, Isagi Yoichi,\n\n...\n\nhe isn't some prodigy soccer player. He is actually quite average, but watching him overcome the many trials of blue lock and continuously evolve his soccer skills and his ego is what makes this anime so entertaining to watch. In addition, the animation complements the style of the manga so well. The flame effect around the character's eyes and the aura they emit when they enter the zone just feels so invigorating to watch. This is why it is so disappointing that in the second half of this anime, the animation quality has notably decreased. \n\nI was watching the second half of this anime and I just couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. The blue flame effect that surrounds isagi when he enters the zone is now replaced with an ugly green aura that doesn't look nearly as good and the character movements feel a lot stiffer than earlier in the season. The set pieces still look great but it is a far cry from what we were getting earlier in the season. The animation is not bad by any means but it is just disappointing to see an anime with such amazing quality diminish later in the season. \n\nOverall \n\nAnimation (as of now) - 6/10\n\nStory - 9/10\n\nWriting - 9/10\n\nCharacters - 8/10\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by rmkline (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 11, 2023\n\nDxpi\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (18/24 eps)\n\n There are certainly better sports anime out there so Why blue lock?Why does blue lock amas this amount of hype?\n\nWell because it fricking slaps.\n\nWhether you're a manga reader or anime watcher. \n\nblue lock pulls you in with its interesting premise and art style. \n\nto some ppl its a spit in the face as to what the sport represents\n\nBut people need to realize its fictionalized and not supposed to be realistic\n\nand this is where i think blue lock shines. \n\nIts because its unrealistic they can pull off anything and make sense of it\n\n...\n\neach characters have their own personality their own ideals and mentality \n\nthat they develop and this is what shapes their ego. What does it mean to be a striker? In blue\n\n it is as simple as who scores more goals because The point of your ego is to be better than everybody else, how to you display that in the game, its to score more goals.\n\nBlue lock at its core is just pure unbounded Hype, a fast-paced anime based on the inspiring journey of our Isagi Yoichi.\n\nBlue lock really excels at their characters unlike other sports anime there is only so much that\n\na character can develope but that's not the case in blue lock, consistently gets better and better. \n\nit represents what it means to win what it means to Want to win\n\nthis is what sports anime is that is what sports anime could be just pure hype.\n\nStudio 8bit did a really good job adapting this voice actors are grea so I would recommend this to anyone basically lol\n\n 7.7/10\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Dxpi (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 31, 2023\n\nchristopher2572\n\nRecommended\n\n Firstly the CGI looks horrid. Even the normal soccer animations are only decent which is quite a shame, as the manga apparently has great art. \n\nBlue Lock is similar to Kuroko No Basket in cosplaying as a sports anime despite being a superhero shonen. That¬¥s not bad per se I really enjoy Kuroko No Basket. What annoyed me with Blue Lock was the complete disregard for any soccer knowledge. There are only strikers, the ego vs team idea is completely idiotic and most of their abilities seem like the Mangaka just looked over the stats of Football Manager and asked himself what would happen if\n\n...\n\nhe gave one 10 points more than the maximum. \n\nDespite that, I think the idea of a Squid Game esque sports anime is quite fun. There are some fun moments and while Blue Lock is too over the top for me it got me to marathon it in about two sittings. I am a tad concerned about how they gonna work around the setting restrictions in the future seasons. Especially as some non Blue Block players have already been introduced. \n\nFor a first season it¬¥s interesting enough but I to fucking god hope they fix the animations next time. Some of the CGI shots looked genuinely worse than Berserk 2016 stuff.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by christopher2572 (\n19\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 29, 2023\n\nEoussama\n\nRecommended\n\n Title: \"Blue Lock: A Winning Play in the World of Soccer Anime!\"\n\n\"Blue Lock\" defies all expectations and strikes a winning goal in the realm of sports anime! With its unique premise, captivating characters, and adrenaline-pumping action, this series proves that football anime can be shockingly good.\n\nAt its heart, \"Blue Lock\" centers around Yoichi Isagi, a talented striker haunted by a crucial decision that altered the course of his high school soccer team's fate. When he receives an invitation to the controversial Blue Lock project, Isagi's journey to become the star striker for the Japanese national team takes off like a rocket.\n\nThe brilliance of \"Blue Lock\"\n\n...\n\nlies in its originality. Rarely do we encounter sports anime that embrace such an unconventional and intriguing concept. The battle royal-style competition, where 300 U-18 strikers compete fiercely to be the chosen one, injects a fresh dose of excitement into the soccer genre. As we follow Isagi and his fellow participants through solo and team challenges, the tension rises, and we can't help but root for their dreams and ambitions.\n\nWhat sets \"Blue Lock\" apart is its character-driven storytelling. Each participant brings a distinct personality, backstory, and style to the field. Witnessing their growth and camaraderie as they strive to achieve their dreams is both heartwarming and inspiring. Yoichi Isagi stands at the forefront as a relatable protagonist, grappling with the ethical implications of Blue Lock while facing the internal struggle to claim victory.\n\nThe animation and art direction deserve a standing ovation. The fluidity and intensity of the football matches are visually captivating, and the character designs give life to the diverse cast. Whether it's the adrenaline-fueled action or the emotional depth during character moments, \"Blue Lock\" never fails to deliver the goods.\n\nMoreover, the soundtrack keeps the excitement alive with its stirring tunes, elevating the emotional impact of each scene. The combination of excellent animation, superb character development, and a powerful soundtrack creates a truly immersive experience for viewers.\n\n\"Blue Lock\" takes the beautiful game of soccer and transforms it into an exhilarating and thought-provoking journey. It embodies the spirit of competition, determination, and passion that drives athletes to reach for the stars. This anime proves that football is not just a sport; it's a vehicle to explore the complexities of human ambition and the pursuit of greatness.\n\nIn conclusion, \"Blue Lock\" is a slam dunk in the world of sports anime. If you've ever doubted the excitement of football on the screen, this series will undoubtedly convert you into a fan. Get ready to cheer, gasp, and feel the triumph of victory, as \"Blue Lock\" delivers an enthralling experience that scores big in every aspect. Lace-up your boots and dive into the action ‚Äì this anime is a winner!\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Eoussama (\n438\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 6, 2023\n\nkriqued\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (17/24 eps)\n\n I want to give my opinion about this series (without having previously read the manga) to say that I really like it a lot, I have read various opinions but what I think is best is for everyone to judge for themselves.

If that‚Äôs all this series would be (I know it isn‚Äôt - just caught up with the manga), this wouldn‚Äôt hold my attention, but over the course of one season, it has so far. The different egos involved and how they collaborate and clash are entertaining, the development of its characters feels organic, and the animation is pretty great for a soccer anime, albeit with some caveats for running CGI. The biggest knock against it is that it‚Äôs simple,\n\n...\n\nthough even this far in, there‚Äôs already a coming shift to the series to level up its setting. A lesser knock is that many of the characters don‚Äôt get and aren‚Äôt important enough to get any development. With so many in this anime, it‚Äôs hard to give them all the kind of attention that would require, but even with that in mind, there‚Äôs less development than I‚Äôd like, especially as regards their backgrounds.\n\nStill, I‚Äôm a fan of what they‚Äôre doing, even if they‚Äôre not taking any big swings yet.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by whiteflame55 (\n319\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 29, 2023\n\nUchiller\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (15/24 eps)\n\n Sports anime are great, aren't they? Blue lock is not an exception. I never imagined i would enjoy watching football since i don't really enjoy watching it irl. \n\nBlue lock is your usual above decent sport anime. It has the ok story, the strong moments (goosebumps or sad) and it keeps you entertained throughout the whole show (up until now at least).\n\nIt also deviates from other sport anime (e.g. kuroko or haikyu) in the sense that it does not focus so much in team power but rather in individual skills which is a nice new catch in my opinion. \"We can do it together if\n\n...\n\nwe all try\" does not really apply in this anime. The plot is also quite interesting but not something extraordinary.\n\nSurely, it is not as realistic as some people would like to, but lets be honest. If you want to watch realistic football go watch live football or something. The anime focuses only on one position and wants to emphasize the fact that by producing the player that can master this position can lead his team to victory. Interesting concept? Yes. Realistic concept? Maybe yes, maybe no but Who cares? \n\nThe animation when the match is played is unfortunately (like in many new other anime) CGI, which makes it a bit (to very) ugly. However, the anime does not focus that much on the actual match but rather on individual thinking and decisions of the players. Therefore, the scenes with CGI are not that frequent. However, putting CGI in a sports anime, which is de facto a genre of anime that is based on motion, is wrong in my view.\n\nOverall, it is a great new sports anime and does the job very good and interestingly so far.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Uchiller (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 3, 2023\n\nIAmGrace\n\nRecommended\n\n As a football enthusiast, this is a really nice anime to begin with. I particularly enjoy anime that features a character who is trying to develop but is still in the learning period, but he overcomes and outperforms others. The characters in this anime are fantastic. It's simple to connect with the characters, and the animation is excellent. Without a dull episode, every episode is fantastic.

From the start, the premise is intriguing: a project aimed at creating Japan's most selfish and lethal striker, challenging the idea of teamwork that has always characterized collective sports.\n\nI enjoyed the intensity and fierce competition between the characters. The series does not shy away from showing the dark side of football, highlighting how ruthless high-level sports can be. However, as the story progresses, I realized that the characters are quite one-dimensional, almost all motivated by selfishness and personal ambition, which, while aligned with the theme of the series, can\n\n...\n\nbecome repetitive.\n\nVisually, \"Blue Lock\" is impressive. The action scenes are dynamic and vibrant, and the visual effects during critical moments add tension and excitement. However, at times I felt that the plot moves at a somewhat accelerated pace, leaving little room for in-depth character development.\n\nIn summary, it‚Äôs an exciting anime if you enjoy extreme action and competition, but don‚Äôt expect too much depth in character evolution or a traditional focus on teamwork. If you like to see the harsher side of sports, this is the show for you.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by alberrtorres (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 30, 2025\n\nRon014\n\nRecommended\n\n ‚öΩ No spoiler review\n\nStory: In a timeline somewhat after the defeat of team Japan in the 2018 World Cup, a guy with crazy eyes and a red-hair chick convince the JFU that there's no future for the Japanese soccer if things stay the way they are, remaining trash forever with no leading superstar and so project Blue Lock is given birth. 300 promising youth are invited to a huge facility, but there's a catch, there are only strikers. In a battle for survival to devour each other, only scoring goals matter, if you lose you're kicked out and your pro-career is over. Will you gamble\n\n...\n\nyour future to become the world's best striker? \n\nOpinion: If you trying this thinking it's a realistic soccer anime, you're dead wrong. In fact, i'm not a soccer fan, crybaby players, the huge field, it takes minutes for the ball to arrive from one side to the other, long pauses and the slow pace makes me falls asleep, i prefer fast pace physical Hockey, but back to my review. This is a combination between the anime Kuroko no basket + Big Brother tv show, so if you liked that anime, this is basically the soccer version and you gonna love it, but there's different component introduced here, the unrealistic Egoism. So with sports teams anime it's always about teamwork, it works differently here. First the teams are made entirely on strikers, no defense players, no goalie, they put them in the same positions, but they're still strikers (even the goalie lmao) and most of them thinking about how they can score a goal instead of teamwork and passing. Despite the anime focusing on the trend of being selfish and no teamwork, there's still teamwork here, players are thinking how to use each other's strengths to get to the scoring box, so it gets kind of confusing at times with what message the story trying to deliver, but the anime is still very entertaining. The \"big brother facility\" also have an impact here as you see players trying to devour each other and be the scorer themselves so they'll get to stay in the program or get a starter spot in the lineup and not being taken over by someone else. I avoided this anime when it started and even the second season because i don't like soccer, i decided to give it a try and ended up binging it, unlike the real sport this is fast and crazy good, and i appreciate the different approach to make it more exciting and introducing different rules, it doesn't have to be realistic. \n\nüî• HOT BONUSUS:\n\n1. As most high tense dramatic animes you get the long monologues of players inner thoughts while the time freeze, or somehow they managing to have a conversation with the opponent player while the play is happening which i always find hilarious, \n\n2. Sick face expressions, not including \"that\" one freak that looks and sounds like he's having an orgasm when he scores.\n\n3. God-tier animation + soundtracks.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Ron014 (\n15\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 29, 2024\n\n2am331ah\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (22/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock, in my opinion, is okay. It is a sports and comedy anime that encourages self-confidence, reason, and working on choosing the right person over the wrong one. The thing that I did not like was the story of the monsters, followed by Meguru BACHIRA and also that the chatter in it was more than the gameplay. The last thing I would like to say is the release date. It was wrong because it coincides with the 2022 World Cup, and this is it, but like all anime, it is great.\n\nTo complete this review, we must answer these questions:\n\nIs the story unique? If it\n\n...\n\nwas predictable, did you enjoy it anyway because you like the genre/setting?\n\nThe answer to this question is no. There are many sports anime, and I do not know how to enjoy them, to be honest, but I loved the sportsmanship to win.\n\nDo you think the art style is appropriate for the story?\n\nYes, it fits surprisingly well.\n\nWere the characters well-rounded? Did they have flaws and strengths, or were they unusually strong, smart, or stupid?\n\nOf course, every character has flaws and weaknesses; otherwise, it would become ridiculous.\n\nDid the characters react to situations and events in a realistic way?\n\nSomewhat, yes, but in the end, it depends on the person.\n\nDo you think others will enjoy or dislike this series, even if you don't? Why?\n\nMaybe they will enjoy it, and maybe not, because it depends on the person's taste.‚öΩüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by 2am331ah (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 22, 2024\n\nDompa112\n\nRecommended\n\n Im not that interested in sports anime. It needs to be more than just slice of life or more realistic drama like take on the sport. Before this one i could count the numbers of sportsamine ive seen on one hand. My favorite is One outs. Which is more psychology focused with lots of mind games. Since Blue Lock wasnt in any other genre than sports i wasnt sure this would be to my liking but pretty quickly you notice this isnt your average drama/slice of life sports anime but much more intense and bizarre. \n\nThe methods used to try and bring forward the best\n\n...\n\nstriker. The intense synergy between the players. Team mates and opponents. The games between them, not just the teams but individually. A strong cast of characters that were interesting to follow. Loved the real world references and view of fotball as a whole as someone very familiar to the game. Perfect blend of very over the top thinking about the game with more realistic and factual stuff.\n\nMusic didnt stand out. Not bad but nothing that caught my attention to much. \n\nAnimation went from lesser good use of cgi to some really cool character animations. Great VA. \n\nThis is one to keep watching for sure. Looking forward to the second season. It starts out as a strong 8/10 for me.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Dompa112 (\n98\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 3, 2024\n\nleyren1683\n\nRecommended\n\n my first ever review on here and I was NEVER interested in sports animes like it seemed like a bunch of boys running after a ball w some coming-of-age and comedic points dropped in but OH BOY. holy shit. right from the get go I realised this is not just a casual fun sports anime about growth and yada yada. shit is SERIOUS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL and ngl kinda dark and I was sold. i was so sold I ended up finishing 24 episodes in two days. \n\nBlue Lock is realistic in terms of character development and as a psychological commentary of humans/ football players/ on\n\n...\n\npersonal growth/ self-improvement. To have someone so ready to accept change and level up in an understandable and relatable way that is SO HYPED is truly satisfying. I personally hate it when the mc is presented as this weak feeble lil shit and only provides a 'special' 'only you can' thing to the team when in reality they're just there as the bare minimum emotional support nor when they are some god and everyone else doesn't have the basic logical skills or critical thinking skills. So, in addition to the other characters of the show having adequate screentime and personal evolutions, and if I have yet mentioned --- THE HYPE OF THE GAME EVEN WHEN IDK ANYTHING ABT FOOTBALL, Blue Lock is extremely enjoyable to watch and follow along our characters' journeys.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by leyren1683 (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 27, 2024\n\nGeNeTiC7123\n\nRecommended\n\n Blue Lock is an‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶good anime, not bad. I‚Äôd argue that if there‚Äôs something that heavily bring it down it would have to be the animation‚Ä¶.everything else is pretty solid. Characters, plot, pacing it isn‚Äôt bad. As i saw someone put it like in a comment section elsewhere‚Ä¶. This show isn‚Äôt about soccer, it‚Äôs about growing as a person while dealing with other‚Äôs being better than you and going through failures. I think it tackles all the feelings of it, and what an ego is pretty well. The characters, Isagi isn‚Äôt a bad main character to follow though the whole show with. I really\n\n...\n\nlike the scenes when he acts all hysterical and dramatic XD. The rest are fine. I would have said that a problem i have with this show is that unlike Haikyuu, we really don‚Äôt get to see the opposing team shine as much but, that‚Äôs the whole point of this show 90% of the players in the opposing team get locket out (eliminated) so why flesh out characters that were never going to see again to begin with? So I‚Äôll let that slide. They could had fleshed out Nagi‚Äôs Team though since he has his own short spinoff but they didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ could had at least focused on another player in his team that wasn‚Äôt Nagi, Reno, and Zansetsu? (I forgot his name) but they didn‚Äôt. I really like all the Ed‚Äôs and OP‚Äôs. Both openings are both really intense and upbeat and both the endings are just relaxing and cool to vibe too. Now the soccer games themselves! They are filled with such intensity and fluid animations, pretty exhilarating to watch‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶is what i would have loved to say about them, unfortunately they‚Äôre really not‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs the show‚Äôs weakest part and where I‚Äôd say it REALLY needed to shine. The animation only stood out on the 1st episode‚Ä¶. It did not keep up all the way. Outside that episode there‚Äôs only like 3-4 shots afterwards that look good‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs it. it‚Äôs a darn shame because i haven‚Äôt even mentioned the soundtrack yet. IF you were to ignore the plot and would had seen one of their games (Let‚Äôs imagine it had good animation) with that soundtrack in the background‚Ä¶. I could confidently had said that it has the best sport scenes that any anime could have had to offer‚Ä¶..unfortunately once again it doesn‚Äôt. (The animation, not the soundtrack) The soundtrack in my opinion is phenomenal and goes with the Blue Lock setting like peanut butter and jelly. It‚Äôs just filled with so much energy and intensity. You couldn‚Äôt have chosen or made a better soundtrack for Blue Lock than the one it has‚Ä¶‚Ä¶if only the an- i‚Äôll stop lol. I‚Äôm making it out to seem like it has horrendous animation and it doesn‚Äôt its just okay-ish but okay-ish isn‚Äôt what was needed for this type of anime. In a nutshell Okay animation, decent plot/characters, and phenomenal soundtrack.

In short 'carried by animation.' \n\n‚Äî They said blue lock is not about friendship but the whole series says otherwise. The characters are more friendly and intimately close to each other than haikyuu. They win by the use of friendship and comradely, it's just they talk like children and always arguing and cursing but they are really close, it's almost giving a boys love vibe. ‚Äî\n\nBlue Lock is definitely about power of friendship. Don't deny it. \n\nStory (1): \n\nAtleast they tried to do something new. However, the whole concept became failure instead. Because the author wanted to create a football\n\n...\n\nworld and a team consist only of strikers, the whole plot is repetitive. Main reason why it's repetitive is because the characters are already overpowered and already very good at playing football so there's nothing to be written anymore in terms of development as a player. The whole story or the plot is now more about personality development where players get to know how to be more kind, friendly and get along.\n\nThe author's only way to make the whole story going on is to introduce more and more characters so that Isagi have more competitions, and for them to create more story/character development (personality development) arcs. It's a recycle of events but with different characters as the topic. \n\nTactics and football knowledge is very few and most of the time inaccurate and made up. The author is making his own football rules, I mean it's kind of understandable because blue lock is just pure fantasy afterall, but I don't like it.\n\nCharacters (3):\n\nCharacters are fun to watch but they have the same personalities, just different voices and looks but are written the same. Isagi is one of the most lame main character I've ever encountered. He's already overpowered but he's still getting left behind. He only know how to talk big.\n\n‚ÄîDialogues‚Äî \n\nCringe and Idiotic. \n\nBack then, when I see people saying blue lock's dialogues is cringe and stupid, i thought they're just overreacting. But when I saw it myself, it really is cringe and stupid. It's true. During matches and practice, instead of talking about football stuffs, or just y'know normal conversations between players, they are instead saying bunch of random words and cringe quotes that doesn't make any sense, plus the weird reaction...\n\n\"Acceleration!\"\n\n\"Accelerate!\"\n\n\"Dash\"\n\n\"I'm gonna kill you!\"\n\n\"I'm gonna devour you!\"\n\n\"fertilization!\"\n\n*boogsh!*\n\n*swish*\n\n*aaaaaahhhhhhhhrrrgggg*\n\n\"dying is part of playing football\"\n\n\"im better than you squirt\"\n\n\"the ball is like an egg going on it's nest\"\n\nand many more, and so on and so fort...üòÇand the fact that they're saying most of this on their own teammates... \n\nI CAN'T ‚Äî \n\nAnimation (7):\n\n8bit is not a sports studio maybe that's why they don't know how sports pacing works. Blue Lock's pacing is fast and mess, I don't know if it's the same in the manga but that's how it is in the anime. Animation is sometimes like a slideshow but it's fine, like I said above, it's visually entertaining. \n\nArt (6): \n\nIt's fine. But sometimes it's too exaggerated it's also gives cringe. Facial expressions are over the top, their uniforms are weird asf. But it's still fine I guess.\n\nMusic & OST (6): \n\nFine but nothing special. OP & ED is bad but I like the OSTs\n\nOverall (3):\n\nBlue Lock is like, \"I'm gonna fvck your ass using my football\" & \"I like you but you're getting in my way in becoming the greatest striker in the world so ill kill you instead\" ... kind of thing. Yeah it's not for me.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by LordeThundrr (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 27, 2023\n\nWhatley117\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (20/24 eps)\n\n I was actually shocked when I saw that the top reviews for this anime were so low. With them labeling it as \"cringe\" and that the show focuses on strikers too much instead of other positions... .The whole concept of the \"Blue Lock\" is that Japanese football players make great midfielders, defensive players, and goalies but don't have enough \"ego\" or Arrogence/Confidence that great strikers need to have. Japan already has a bunch of world class goalies, defenders, and midfielders. They dont have any world class strikers, therfore they need to make one. It is very direct, they are trying to make the best striker\n\n...\n\nin the world So they get the best 300 highschool strikers in japan and put them through a kind of squid games competition thing. Yeah the plot is kind of crazy, but in the way that Anime is supposed to be. I enjoyed watching Isagi working through his problems and developing solutions to them, while \"leveling up\". \n\nSports anime are about getting the audience, who normally knows nothing about this sport, informed on how its played and the tactics and strategy involved in winning. Basically an intro to whatever sport it is. Blue Lock accomplished this very well through the thoughts of Isagi. Through his eyes we see the tactics and challenges that he faces and we learn about the sport. I come from a huge Football family, we have supported Arsenel since like the 1950's. I am like the one person who never got into football. I barely know anything about football or any players. And this anime actually got me pretty interested in football. I even showed it to my dad and brothers who NEVER watch anime and they liked it and watch every episode as it releases. My dad even sayed that the challenges that Japanese Football faces in the show are very similar to how soccer/football was played in the united states in the 70's and 80's. Players were just passing the ball around with no drive or plans to score. So I would say that the show does a very accurate job portraying the tactics and strategies of football and simplifies them for easy consumtion by the audience. The show also gives a great insight into sports psycology and the minds of high preforming athletes.\n\nI also liked the theme that your success comes at the cost of other peoples dreams. to be the best you have to be selfish and value your football career over everyone elses. There are consequences to losing and not everyone can be the best.\n\nPlot 8/10\n\nSquid games meets soccer/ football in a very unique way. There's very little filler and the plot is only slightly predicable.\n\nCharacters 8/10\n\nYes they are all handsome anime guys, but they are unique and especially further into the show you see key diferences in motivations and conflicts. It is very satisfying to watch Isagi develope and it is refreshing that he isn't overpowered or completely oblivious like many MCs. His insights and development throughout the show feel natural and victories feel earned.\n\nAnimation 9/10\n\nAction feels smooth and fluid. colors are vibrant. You can tell that the studio put some work into this.\n\nMusic 10/10\n\nThe OP SLAPS and the techno/electrical music that they play at the beginning of matches is a complete VIBE! the music enhances the action and is very well done.\n\nCons\n\nyes there is only one female character and you never see her. also I get very sight BL vibes but nothing close to FREE!\n\nOverall I think it is the best football/soccer anime I've seen, I personally like Blue Lock more than Ao Ashi becase it feels a little crazier and matches are more exciting. And Ao Ashi got a little annoying sometimes.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Whatley117 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 29, 2024\n\nAaronier0O\n\nRecommended\n\n translated by chatgpt, not generated\n\nAlthough I've never been a fan of soccer, the anime Blue Lock completely surprised me and grabbed my attention from the very first minutes. Instead of the typical sports story, I was expecting a plot focused on matches and field strategy, but Blue Lock offers so much more.\n\nWhat struck me the most was its unconventional approach to the subject ‚Äì it's not just about the team winning. Blue Lock focuses on the individual journey of the characters, particularly the main protagonist, who, in order to succeed, must discover his own identity as a player. This anime is about competition, ambition, and\n\n...\n\nstriving for perfection, touching on universal themes like pursuing one's dreams and overcoming personal weaknesses.\n\nEvery character in Blue Lock has their own goals and motivations, and the anime does a great job of showcasing their development. The relationships between the characters are full of tension, uncertainty, and internal conflict. This adds depth to the story and makes me forget about soccer as a sport, instead focusing on the emotions and psychological aspects of the rivalry.\n\nVisually, Blue Lock is dynamic and intense, and the action scenes ‚Äì both on and off the field ‚Äì are brilliantly executed. Even though I'm not a fan of soccer, the adrenaline during watching is genuine.\n\nMoreover, the anime tackles the theme of individualism and what it means to be \"the best.\" There‚Äôs no room for traditional values of teamwork here ‚Äì it‚Äôs a brutal competition to be number one, which sets Blue Lock apart from other sports anime and makes it more fascinating, even for someone who isn‚Äôt interested in sports.\n\nIn conclusion, Blue Lock is more than just an anime about soccer. It‚Äôs a gripping tale of human ambition, determination, and the struggle to find one‚Äôs identity. Even if you don‚Äôt like football, this anime has the potential to draw you into a world full of emotions and challenges.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Aaronier0O (\n7\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 8, 2025\n\nangecritter\n\nRecommended\n\n An intense, stylish, but often times overambitious sports anime with a hefty dose of shounen absurdity.\n\nIntro\n\nBlue Lock portrays soccer as an ego-driven death game wrapped in capitalism and shounen melodrama. It's intense, absurd, and a little bit horny. And honestly, that's what makes it so damn entertaining - but it's not without its issues.\n\nStorytelling/Pacing\n\nThe series spans a standard 24 episodes, which should be enough to tell a tightly paced story. However, the show gets heavily bogged down by its own shounen tropes and poor pacing. The series builds tension well, but too often these moments are buried under bloated internal monologues - especially from Isagi.\n\n...\n\nWhile the psychological aspect is cool at first, the constant ego rants lose impact fast. Isagi's internal monologues are far too often less character exploration and more faux intellectual drivel, and it kills the pacing. Hard. He doesn't develop so much as absorb philosophies like he's a twinky sponge. The matches, as interesting as they are visually, often fall into the realm of Filler Lane, where the characters have to go through an uphill battle in their own minds each time. This is redundant. Either make it more sparse or have different things happen.\n\nThere's an undeniable sense that the show is getting high on its own excess. But when everything is life-or-death... nothing is. It numbs you. High drama becomes background noise. After a while, watching Blue Lock is like listening to Merzbow on top of Kendrick Lamar. It's brilliance beneath a layer of pure exhaustion.\n\nVisuals\n\nThat said, when Blue Lock does fire on all cylinders, it's absolutely brilliant. The animation is top fucking tier in both technical and artistic quality - brimming with passion in every frame, every major character design full of thematic cohesion. The character designs are always so damn sharp, exaggerated, and full of personality. I'll concede that for some of the supporting cast, they fall into the realm of generic anime high schoolers, but it's not a dealbreaker. I would've preferred it to be more of a spectacle, even with less focus on side characters, but for the main cast? Oh yeah, they nailed it. Bachira has that childlike wonder in his eyes and even his hair, Isagi is determined yet youthful, Rin is...okay, Rin is basically just a taller version of Isagi, just with 20% more cynicism. The way the supernatural/psychedelic elements are shown is really great, too - it really utilizes the medium to its advantage by showing a metaphor for how locked in these guys are on the field, even if the ego monsters are a bit jarring. Despite the sensory overload this show is so fond of, the direction knows how to land emotional beats when it matters most. They take this shit so seriously that it can feel like people are dying out here, even when it's \"just\" a soccer game. But since we're talking about animation: why use 3D models for distant characters? It just pulls me out of the scene when there's a clear difference in art styles, even if it's just for select scenes. They look like scrapped PS2 models - cheap and stiff, kinda like the music.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic in Blue Lock is a mixed bag for me. I love the first OP, like the rest of the OPs and EDs, and don't care much for the background music. The OPs really sell that aggressive, youthful conquest for victory - I can feel Bachira's indulgent yet disciplined passion in every note, and the EDs are cute and sentimental. BGM in this series feels like generic electronic-style sports music, it doesn't do anything particularly interesting to hype scenes up and its composition is...fine. I would've been okay with generic music if it fit the tone (sports can be kind of stale) but Blue Lock is anything BUT generic. Why not go all-out with tunes that catch you off guard? The BGM tries to be energetic but lands somewhere between Skrillex impersonator and the soundtrack to a Fortnite crypto scam. I would've loved to see some Masafumi Takada-esque EDM bangers a la Danganronpa V3 to soundtrack the wild action that occurs, or hell, even some banging cyber metal. There was a lot of room to experiment here, but the chance was simply not taken.\n\nThemes\n\nBlue Lock actually has something to say. It's not just about soccer: it's about ego, ambition, and what it means to pursue greatness with complete disregard for teamwork or tradition. It's a sports anime with the plot of a shounen death game, without the death but with all the philosophical dread. I'm not sold on the philosophy it's going for, but what matters most is its believability. These are soccer players with the drive to be the best at any cost - and I can completely see how they come to their primarily self-fulfilling conclusions. It definitely doesn't shy away from showing other perspectives too. Isagi gets treated like a self-serving dick more as the series progresses, and I found it pretty funny how they call out him trying to be the main character of the story. It's no labyrinthine debate, but I'm glad the showrunners are at least a little self-aware. Blue Lock has something to say, but what adds layers is that it never really gives you a straight moral to take. Personally, I see Isagi as a well-meaning occasional bonehead whose ego may eventually eat him alive, but you might see him as a complete asshole that has no regard for his friends. These are conversations that are worth having, and as a sucker for philosophy, I definitely want to talk to some people about how they view the characterization at play here. Despite its interesting themes, however, it can be a little too unsubtle in its delivery at times. I don't need everything to be super nuanced and intricate, but I feel that a lot of the time, Blue Lock kicks back on having clear-cut motivations for everyone that leave little room for intrigue. The show would've done this better if it took more time to build specific perspectives instead of it being primarily an ensemble cast, especially when a few characters rely way too heavily on tropes. (looking at you, Tokimitsu)\n\nTone\n\nTonally, Blue Lock lives in this really odd space between hardcore serious sports shounen and off-the-wall comedy. It's not a perfect contrast by any means, but I'd say that its flaws add more merit and memorability to it, which is an absolute win in my book. Are some of the voice actors going way too hard? Absolutely. But I'd much rather have that than phoned-in performances with nothing interesting going on.\n\nMy Strange Addiction\n\nOkay, let me just break character for a second, because I need to talk about my one true love, Meguru Bachira. This man quickly became my husbando as the series progressed. He's so cute, I love how driven he is, how much romantic tension there is between him and the rest of the cast, and just the sheer passion he has for soccer above LITERALLY anything else. He's the perfect protagonist, and I didn't even realize he was a protagonist until he'd already stolen my heart. I love how he perfectly captures the themes of ego and ambition by being the centerpiece - driven by pure love and passion for everyone on the team via the realm of soccer. Everything about the way he thinks and plays is this perfect harmony of his worldview tying into every action he takes. It's gorgeous. Beyond all the analysis though, my emotional reaction to him is so strong that I just NEED to get this out. What an amazing little creature.\n\nOutro\n\nBlue Lock is so far from perfection it may as well be allergic to it - but it's got style, guts, and a few standout moments that make the ride worth it. Just don't expect a masterpiece. Expect an over-the-top shounen about egos and highly queer existential crises.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by angecritter (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 1, 2024\n\nGintokiee\n\nRecommended\n\n crazy football anime does it need any other reason to be this exhilarating...Bachira my man plays like water passes like beckham...\n\n.\n\nMbappe giving guest entry in the end....good mc not so good credit content but great sports ...\n\nmaking every match feel like a new thing to be invested not the mbappe one that was pure annihilation...\n\n.\n\nand every character having full time to showcase there talent feels winning or losing more interesting good development of characters..\n\n'\n\ni've skipped every op ed just so i could watch the game it was so good...\n\nalthough i would say i was annoyed in the start because igrashi was thinking too much..\n\nand does\n\n...\n\neverything after thinking for 5 minutes it was nerfed down till the end..\n\nother than that cgi at someplaces does standout but it could be easily looked away because of the plot..Great first season hope they don't mess in future..\n\n.\n\nif it will come the next world cup i'll be there until then ....bye...\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Gintokiee (\n22\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 23, 2025\n\nd_saikoh7\n\nRecommended\n\n Blue Lock is an excellent anime that perfectly completes the trio of football anime. I love the realistic aspect of this anime. We see football without super techniques, so everything remains coherent. Each player has their strengths and weaknesses. \n\n Positive Points :\n\n- An incredible animation. \n\n- OSTs that are both great and diverse. \n\n- A mature and serious tone that fits the story perfectly. \n\n- High tension in the matches. \n\n- Good coherence. \n\n- Great moments of tactical thinking. \n\n- An engaging story. \n\n...\n\n- Likable characters. \n\n Negative Points :\n\n- A gloomy, unsettling atmosphere that can feel heavy over time. \n\n- Some plays that are a bit too unrealistic, which makes Blue Lock lose what sets it apart from Captain Tsubasa and Inazuma Eleven, and, more importantly, makes everything feel less coherent. \n\n Conclusion : If you love football and anime, go for it, you‚Äôll love it. \n\n7/10 : Enjoyable Overall\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by d_saikoh7 (\n15\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 14, 2023\n\nMelsonNoronha\n\nRecommended\n\n To be the best. You have to work the best, you have to train the best, eat, and sleep the best. Sometimes, it even takes going through extreme measures, in order to find that best out of someone. Even if what is presented, wouldn't be called Football to you. Football may just be a sport to some, but for a load of people it's very serious business. People eat, sleep, dream football. People travel endless miles, travel to different countries, no matter the cost, to watch their team perform. It may be a sport, but it's a lifestyle for so many, to even many nations,\n\n...\n\nwho want to grasp it by the horns, and be the best in the world.\n\nThis is Blue Lock.\n\nBut to be the best, you need to basically start from somewhere, You can't be the best with mediocare, or just good enough level of talent. You have to find the best. Or even make and train the best.\n\nStory and characters: 8\n\nWhile there are flaws within it's story context, as there is a dozen other positions on a football picture, and you cannot win alone as a striker by yourself. Football is a team effort, and here in Blue Lock, they show it in both forms. Points where they'll show how good it is working within the team, but all the while showing the greatest, can do it by themselves. The best get results, the best deliver, where it be on their own, or with a team. It's proven within the game itself. Taking quotes from real footballers, in order to further prove their points.\n\nThe characters within the show are quite bundle. The best players aren't just known for their skills alone, they have the personalities to boot. Sometimes you need the right kind of characters, in order to succeed. You cannot be weak, you cannot be a weak link, you cannot suffer under pressure. With so many conflicting and determined characters within this line up, and with the story it presents. It's going to be a good product.\n\nArt and sound: 8\n\nBlue Lock has an interesting kind of style that sets it apart from different animes. Just by looking through the characters eyes, is proof in the pudding. Hell, some even look a bit soulless. As if there is a massive focus, a massive serious attention from everyone who is in this process. Everyone has the determination to be the best, and if you don't, you're weak, you're out. Simple as that. I've described some shows as having an in your face style, but with Blue Lock, it's more described as a determined seriousness to it. While one may laugh at the idea of Japan ever wining the World Cup, but with how this show is presented. It's no laughing matter to them. The sound quality too, is top notch, and can't put a foot wrong.\n\nBlue Lock is a different spin on a usual Football anime that has come over the last few years. But it's certainly left a very serious, and impressive impression. Give it a watch .\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MelsonNoronha (\n20\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 20, 2024\n\nPezguy97\n\nRecommended\n\n This is one of the better sports anime, and I do not typically enjoy sports anime and manga. It starts out very strong because it is kind of like the Hunter Exam mixed with soccer. As the story progresses, it however starts to feel like a more conventional High School Sports anime, which makes it a little less gripping. The animation is really good, and a lot of the characters are fun. The funniest character is the Guy who runs the Blue Lock training facility. The voice acting for the characters from other countries were really weird. I would have enjoyed this anime a lot\n\n...\n\nmore if there had been more contrived training exercises that seemingly had nothing to do with soccer, like when they played tag in the beginning.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Pezguy97 (\n54\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 20, 2025\n\nSouraBel\n\nRecommended\n\n A really interesting sport anime.

I liked that it was not always rainbows and butterflies and that they showd the characters struggles and internal dilema. I found it somewehat realistic in a way and that makes the plot more surprizing.\n\nTo me, it is as good as Haikyu!! and Kuroko's Basketball, but the animation are way better and that is what makes it standout. \n\nI really enjoyed watching it and looked forward to the airing of\n\n...\n\nseason 2.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SouraBel (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 23, 2023\n\nGoticaRabuda157\n\nRecommended\n\n There is a good reason why this anime got so popular since its been first officialy streamed.\n\nI believe never before there has been a story that introduces and develops so many well-writen complex delteragonists on a so forward way, that can still focus on the protagonist and on his way to victory. Not to say the multiple twists it takes almost every single episode.\n\nA story being told this way kind of resembles some works like Naruto or One Piece, just a lot shorter and with a more clear narrative objective.\n\nI believe it is easy to enjoy this characters and their interactions, not only because they\n\n...\n\nfeel real most of the time, but also because each of them has their own capability and specialty.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by GoticaRabuda157 (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 14, 2023\n\nBlackBusterMAL\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n English.\n\nA soccer series that wants to give the genre a breath of fresh air and succeeds, but in its wake it also makes many mistakes, this is a much more interesting series than I imagined I thought it would be like the rest of the series in the genre of sports but it gives it an air like a series of fights that I loved, it's simple in the idea that they give us, Japan is a country that wants to have a striker but they can't find him, so they make a program to find him and so It is the main plot here,\n\n...\n\nbut how he does it sometimes fails, as in the case of explaining the techniques or how soccer works, they present us or give us the idea that the perfect player is good by himself but in Real life is not like that, in addition to the fact that the techniques or players seem to be taken more from a video game than from real life, true progress is not seen but is spontaneous and quite convenient for the plot, our protagonist also fails to empathize With him, there are other player issues for which you see his reasons for why they are in this program, but for the main one there is no apparent reason why we would like him to win everything, although it is logical that we also want our protagonist to win because otherwise, how would the plot progress? .\n\nIn short, I think that if you like soccer you will like this series, it entertains you, but I think that what soccer is based on can sometimes fail to give us a more realistic perspective, which is why I emphasized that it seems like a series of fights because it has the same approach of knowing which is the best of the topics and seeing how each person improves.\n\nEspa√±ol.\n\nUna serie de futbol que quiere darle una bocanada de aire fresco al genero y lo logra pero a su paso tambi√©n comete muchos errores, esta es una serie mucho mas interesante de lo que yo me imagine pens√© que seria como el resto de series en el genero de deportes pero le da un aire como estilo serie de peleas que me encanto, es simple en la idea que nos dan, Jap√≥n es un pa√≠s el cual quiere tener a un delantero pero que no lo encuentran, entonces hace un programa para encontrarlo y as√≠ es la trama principal de aqu√≠, pero el como lo realiza a veces falla como es en el caso de explicarte las t√©cnicas o el como funciona el futbol, nos presentan o nos dan la idea de que el jugador perfecto es bueno por si solo pero en la vida real no es as√≠, ademas de que las t√©cnicas o jugadores parecen sacados mas de un videojuego que de la vida real, no se ve un verdadero progreso sino que es espont√°neo y bastante conveniente para la trama, nuestro protagonista ademas falla en que empaticemos con el, hay otros temas jugadores los cuales ves sus motivos del porque est√°n en este programa pero del principal no hay alg√∫n motivo aparente del porque quisi√©ramos que el ganara todo, aunque es l√≥gico que tambi√©n queremos que ganara nuestro protagonista porque sino como avanzar√≠a la trama.\n\nEn fin creo que si te gusta el futbol te va a gustar est√° serie, te entretiene pero creo que en lo que se basa que es el deporte futbol a veces puede fallar en darnos una perspectiva mas realista, por eso hacia hincapi√© a que parece una serie de peleas porque tiene el mismo planteamiento de saber cual es mejor de los temas y ver como van mejorando cada quien.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by BlackBusterMAL (\n123\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 2, 2023\n\nNathadechoco\n\nRecommended\n\n Sports anime that is very unique and presents a fresh idea.

The character can improvise on his own well. I'm sure it will be fun for many people to watch,Because Blue lock has a unique and exciting concept.

I've seen the tropes. How characters unite in the most unlikely ways. The empathetic main character, or the morality at play when put against people who could be good. Rarely done with nuance, and I'll admit, this one gets pretty close to being great, but I really couldn't take it seriously. \n\nBattle Royale, but with soccer. You got monsters who can level the playfield, you've got the underdogs, the great prospects, and our protagonist who is very much a nobody in a sea\n\n...\n\nof potential nobodies. He's gotta climb his way through, alright, sure, fine. I went along with it, and took what was essentially 24 episodes of what I can only describe as an author holding back. \n\nBe it the slow progression, the character dialogue, and the constant weirdness in all of them. First, you can tell the big cast of characters merits diverse personalities. It allows them to stand out, to have their voice, but as a problem, they're too out there, exaggerated, stupid, incoherent. Their way of thinking makes sense for each character, but they get so repetitive. \n\nThey repeat their way of talking every time they're on-screen, just for those three seconds to remind us of their existence. It speaks poorly of the writer's ability to direct them without being edgy, or plain cringe. Stuff like “I have a demon in my heart”. These are highschoolers, close to 18-years-old. If they were middle schoolers, that's the limit, but please, STFU. \n\nSecond. This is an experiment from the author, and you can tell. I've read the author's biggest works before this one, and while still childishly dealing with adult themes, the writing stood out, the characters were given proper depth, since they couldn't cross the line of excess. There were always smaller casts, and thing is, the next season, or part of the story probably works way better since the story rids itself of unneeded characters. However, the most edgy ones stay, and weirder ones just got in, making my optimism utterly stupid. \n\nI wish there was more to chew on, more of an interesting main character. Even if his dynamic is very fresh, being able to predict the playing field, and what not, his personality is as plain as you can imagine. Main character, underdog, nice guy, the least unusual, with a strange awakened state. I'm tired of it, and this simply perpetuates cliché's without being able to break away from them. \n\nThe animation works, the story works, and it moves, but I'll give it a chance to redeem itself. It's not bad, it's just on the verge of being bad. It can only get better if the author manages to truly use its cast, and lesson, to change the protagonist and the people around him. Other than that, it just doesn't stand out that much compared to the author's other works, which have a little more to say about its world than this. \n\n6/10. If the author was trying to make a typical Shonen, you can feel the Victorian style skeleton whispering he should go back to his edgy roots.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by bergars (\n180\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 5, 2023\n\nRadu7767\n\nRecommended\n\n First review here! \n\nJust wanted to let everyone know that this show is about unapologetic hype.

The show sets up a competitive atmosphere where players are pitted against each other in high-stakes matches, with only the best making it to the national team. This leads to some intense moments and gripping drama, as players struggle to prove their worth and secure a spot on the team.\n\nOne of the strengths of the anime is its character development. Each player in Blue Lock is given their own backstory, motivations, and unique playing style.\n\n...\n\nThe show spends time exploring the characters' pasts, which helps to flesh out their personalities and make them more relatable. The character designs are also excellent, with each player having a distinct look that reflects their personality and style of play.\n\nThe animation in Blue Lock is also top-notch. The soccer matches are well choreographed and exciting to watch, with fluid movements and dynamic camera angles. The animation also effectively portrays the physical toll that playing soccer can take on the body, with players shown sweating and gasping for air after a hard-fought match. The attention to detail in the animation really adds to the immersive experience of the show.\n\nAnother standout aspect of Blue Lock is its music. The opening and ending themes are both catchy and energetic, perfectly capturing the high-energy atmosphere of the show. The soundtrack also features a mix of upbeat and emotional tracks that complement the on-screen action and heighten the tension during key moments.\n\nWhile the anime has many strengths, it does have a few flaws. One of the main issues is the pacing. The show moves at a breakneck speed, which can be overwhelming at times. The fast pace means that some of the character development and emotional moments are rushed, which can make it difficult to fully invest in the story and its characters.\n\nAnother issue is the lack of focus on the other positions in soccer. While Blue Lock is centered around creating the ultimate striker, the show neglects to explore the importance of other positions on the team. This can make it feel like the show is oversimplifying the game of soccer, which may be frustrating for fans of the sport.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MissyMoo10 (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 18, 2023\n\nNoy_Rican\n\nRecommended\n\n \"blue lock one of my favourite\"\n\nThe highly anticipated Blue Lock anime delivers an exhilarating and sensational experience that surpasses expectations, making it an absolute triumph.

It brings up how Japanese culture effects their skills at sporting, what it means to be a striker, and what it means to \"get good.\" Jinpachi Ego (the coach) as a character makes you think, and when you do, you realize that these concepts you\n\n...\n\nnever thought about are actually pretty true. (THIS OPINION IS NOT SHARED BY EVERYONE)\n\nYeah, making a comically futuristic and dystopian system to make a good striker is silly, and has made probably most people think \"wow thats stupid\" (holographic gks, im looking at you), but it works.\n\nCreating a system of essentially, football hunger games, to turn someone into an egoist striker is both interesting to watch and a fair concept in general, especially considering fail here means your career for a sport or profession you love, is over for the rest of your life.\n\nPlot - 7\n\nThe characters are a mixed bag. Some are random quirky villains or just weirdos and some are borderline main characters. In the first arc, about half of the team feels like filler with over exaggerated quirks and personalities. It's the other half that make the show shine.\n\nAll of the important side characters are very important, impactful, well written, etc. They are developed in a way that they feel like the main character, like real people, with real motivations and emotions. The character's development with each other is what makes this show great. \n\nAt first, they learn to fight with each other, next, they fight against each other. The flexibility that this show has to be able to team former allies against each other, and force them to adapt and develop again, is why I think this show is great.\n\nCharacters - 10 (after first arc).\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely fire. The heavy metal and thrilling soundtrack that is played at the exact moments the characters are having a thrilling moment is both chillingly good, and accurate. Are the first OP and EDs doodoo? Yes, they both are trash. Are the second ones good? Absolutely. The soundtrack is composed to provide the thrill that the characters are feeling at that moment, and that is what makes both the soundtrack and characters phenomenal.\n\nSoundtrack - 10\n\nOne off stuff\n\n-Yes, characters launch into dialog mid match, and yes, it does feel cringe and pretty bad. Would I blame you for disliking it? No, I disliked it too, but the dialog is still meaningful and developing, and is also an essential component to Blue Lock.\n\n-Is the entire show over dramatic? Yes, very over dramatic. But nearly every Shonen anime is over dramatic, it's what makes the genre. The show and anime as a whole would be pretty boring if it wasn't dramatic.\n\n-Is this anime for everyone? No.\n\n-Some people might like this anime for different reasons, like its cringe dialog, or exaggerated story, which is fine. If you enjoy shows \"so bad they're good,\" you can see it.\n\nThis anime is niche. You may enjoy it because of the exaggerated plot or dialog, or you might enjoy it for the phenomenal development throughout the entire show.

And lo and behold, the one to step up to the challenge is none other than 8bit, a studio mostly known for the That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime and Grisaia series. When I first got the news about this adaptation I did get some worries about how they would deal with a sports anime but thought it couldn’t be too bad since they did a good job with Stars Align. In fact, while\n\n...\n\nbeing completely different in tone, both Stars Align and Blue Lock are similar in the sense that both are more than just sports series, one being more of a drama than a sports anime for most of it and the other taking more of a battle shounen-like approach to sports. All that said here’s my thoughts about this adaptation.\n\n+ The openings really slap and the first ending is also really good. The rest of the OST is fine but nothing mind blowing. \n\n+ They hit the jackpot on some of their VA choices, especially for characters like Bachira and Nagi.\n\n+ They’ve kept a good pacing for these series. There might be some scenes that were left out (I don’t really remember, I’ve read those chapters long ago) but they kept the essential parts in and there really hasn’t been a boring moment in any episode so far.\n\n+ The post credits segments are a good addition, allowing the viewer to get to know the characters’ personalities, particularly the lesser important secondary characters.\n\n- Now let’s stop beating around the bush, the animation SUCKS. I knew that whoever tried to adapt this series would have a big task in front of them. Of all the genres of anime, sports anime are the ones that require the most attention to their animation since you know… athletes move…like a lot… during sports. On top of that, they chose a series drawn by Yuusuke Nomura. While he doesn’t have many reputable works under his name, Yuusuke is definitely a talented artist. His inventive paneling, dynamic poses and thick lines make the characters pop out of the pages and really gives you the sensation of movement. And here lied the issue for 8bit. While they can definitely push out 1 or 2 episodes with some great animation in a 1 cour season and give you that sweet sweet sakuga, their animation is mediocre for most it. They have some outliers like the 1st season of Tensura or the Stars Align, but majority of their adaptations are really substandard (or maybe standard in an era where studios care more about pushing out as many series as possible than actually making good shows). Long gone are the days where CGI wasn’t really a thing in anime and now studios have become too reliant on it. 8bit is guilty of this. Don’t get me wrong, CGI can be used to great effect and can definitely help with animating stuff like crowds in the background. But when you pan over 3 or 4 CGI character models whose faces show any emotion running towards a ball with the stiffest running animation, it’s hard for me to take them seriously as a studio. And worst of all, their 2D animation isn’t particularly that good either. Some of the characters haven’t transitioned that well from the manga to the anime (like Barou, I know his hair is corny but it looks so much corny in the anime). This is especially noticeable in their running scenes, where they distort the characters, making them look stubby for some reason. But I’ll give them some props for their effects, like the auras and the eyes, they did decent. \n\nSince I’m reading the manga I think I should touch on the story segment separately. 8bit has kept true to the source material and so the story’s strengths and flaws are on the writer and not the studio. I guess I could write this part in a manga review but I really don’t feel like making another one.\n\nThe story is really fun. Like I mentioned before the story takes a lot of elements from battle shounen and applies it to football. The matches are literal fights between players both opposition and teammates to see who’s the best striker. It gives you a bunch of different players with different approaches to how they play, kinda how you’d get fighters with different fighting styles in a battle shounen. And while much of it isn’t very realistic to actual football, it conveys the feeling of football really well. In general, it's pure hype.\n\nThe plot is fine, it presents you with an interesting setting but has some inconsistencies, though nothing that completely shatters the world. My biggest issue is how the author stops caring about the main driving point for the series, finding the best striker (heavy spoilers ahead). Season 1 should cover at least most if not the whole of the 2nd selection arc, which is the last arc where players are actually being eliminated from Blue Lock (at least up to where the manga is atm of writing this). During the 1st and 2nd selections we see lots of strikers with actual potential being eliminated yet players who have no real potential shown so far or have switched positions get to stay. There are some people among the BL fandom who been saying that Ego never meant to just find the best striker but the best players for every position. But if that’s the case than it completely breaks the plot and takes all the fun out of it. He literally preaches about how players should rather “score a hat trick and lose 3-4 than assist and win 1-0”. So Blue Lock should be about guys who want to score goals, actual strikers.\n\nAnother grievance I have with the series is how they make it seem as if the stakes are much higher than they actually are. If you get eliminated you can't play for the national team ever yet players act as if they can no longer go pro.\n\nFor last, I’d like to address the meat heads of the Blue Lock fandom (which believe me. there are a lot of them in this fandom). Blue Lock isn’t that much more original than other sports anime just because “it isn’t about friendship” or “it’s about ego”. First of all, stop calling yourself an egoist online, it's cringe. Second, there’s a lot of \"friendship\" in this anime as well and the teams only work because the characters are friends or at least tolerate each other. I really didn't want to make comparisons here, but how different is that from how the academy players and trialists tolerate each other in Ao Ashi? (y'all know damn well why I made this comparison). Third, it still has all the other clichés from other football anime. It has the important game where the score ends up like 5-4 with a goal in the last second of the game, it has the team that completely obliterates the MCs team, it has the benchwarmers that are there just to give commentary on the game (not yet but in future arcs), it even has its own Ryo Ishizaki. My point is that the series has a good gimmick but it doesn't really take it above most other sports anime in what comes to it's story.\n\nSummarized: Blue Lock (anime) is an underwhelming adaptation made by 8bit for one of the hottest animanga properties at the moment. While it has some positives points it completely falls flat due to a lack of effort/investment put up by the studio. I would recommend anyone who reads this review to skip this anime and just read the manga.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kwantico (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 9, 2023\n\nmrlmaokun\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (3/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock came out with some serious hype. It gained a lot of traction during the 2022 FIFA world cup, a strategic release decision no doubt, and despite my waning interest in anime as a medium, I love football enough that it really piqued my interest to watch it.\n\nIt sucks.\n\nI appreciate the attempts to exaggerate and personify the aspects of the sport and its athletes, particularly the \"lethality\" and \"composure\" that the greatest strikers are synonymous with, but the author forgot to give each character something just as equally important as an ego: a brain.\n\nBut bad characters, premise, animation, sound track and arguably art style\n\n...\n\naside, it seems like no one involved in this show's production actually watches football. The term forward, center forward and striker are all used interchangeably when they can all mean completely different things. A lot of the players referenced for inspiration, like Neymar and Messi, are not strikers, so it's pretty damning of the production team's lack of basic knowledge of the sport. Hilariously a character thinks less of Messi as he hadn't yet won the world cup, which really did not age well.\n\nIf you don't care about football and are more interested in the show's madness for entertainment, then by all means enjoy. Personally I'm torn between dropping it right here at episode 3 or seeing how much more stupid it can get. \n\nIf you do care about football, it might be worth making fun of it as a parody of the game we love. But even then, watching a live game would be more entertaining, as evidenced by that crazy world cup we just witnessed.\n\nAll in all, I do not recommend this show.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by mrlmaokun (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 4, 2023\n\nVampiir\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (20/24 eps)\n\n Blue Lock brings a different concept to football animes, I myself am a great fan of the sport so when the initial speech of the character Ego Jimpachi was presented I was caught of guard. The anime discusses in the first episode how Japanese football is not good enough as it is, and that it takes a striker capable of rivaling the big stars of the football world for Japan to win the dream World Cup.\n\nI would say that the egotistic speech caught me off guard I was not expecting that and my initial thought was how it didn't make sense since football is a\n\n...\n\nteam sport, every position is important. However the anime is relevant to the current scenario of japanese football, Japan has been surprising more and more with its performances in past editions of the World Cup having a style of play focused on passes, but failing to have a striker able to score consistently, in this context this anime fits perfectly and touches on issues relevant to the japanese football fans. \n\nThe story is built around the matches. The anime does a good job adding an emotional load on each match, which makes each one special, along with the animation you get stuck in the chair eager to know the outcome. Blue Lock is right to make the protagonist lose a few matches, so you're never sure of the real outcome and that makes you more involved in the plot.\n\nThe characters are fun, for the most part they're charismatic and the anime does a good job developing the secondary characters. The protagonist (Isagi Yoichi) does not start the anime as a genius, and unlike other works of the same genre his development is gradual and slow which can annoy some people (although the rhythm is better in the anime than in the manga). Antagonists such as Itoshi Rin, although not so well developed, fulfill their role of serving as an obstacle for the protagonist.\n\nAbout some parts of the story like Bachira's monster and other visual representations used in the anime, I would say that they are visual representations of a feeling. The aura of that character, the flames would be visually the sensation he is passing to the opponent at that moment. Much like Kuruko I do not see these details of Blue Lock as powers but visual exaggerations that make the story more interesting visually, but I don't deny that it may be something unattractive to some people.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Vampiir (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 23, 2023\n\nKariminO\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n I'm writing this as someone who has played and watched football/soccer for a solid 15 years..so i know everything about this sport inside and out.\n\nThe road that this first season has took is very interesting...\n\nUnlike most football animes traditional \"high school tournament 11 v 11\", Blue Lock has mixed it up with stuff that can only be done on the streets with your friends, which many many football fans will relate to...such as playing tag with a football, playing a 3,4 or 5 a side match, playing wildly and challenging each other...\n\nIt's a big plus to the anime and that is why I'm giving it\n\n...\n\na 6/10 instead of a 3.\n\nYes blue lock has offered a different experience with good animation and energy...But they have TOTALLY murdered it with unnecessary monologues..\n\nSeriously some monologues took as long as 4 minutes..as I had to skip most of them I found myself in ep 20 in less than three hours..\n\nThey had an abundance of materials that could add a bit more action...instead they've given us a 3 minute key highlights of a match with 15 minute monologue/flashback per episode (except for one or two episodes).\n\nI really don't care about the plot, character development, depth or any of that crap...I just wanted to see a wild action-packed football anime as the hype suggested...Instead I saw an anime that is the equivalent of an erectile dysfunction..\n\nNot satisfying enough sadly.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by KariminO (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 26, 2024\n\nMyNameIsMike\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n I started watching this show right after I finished Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood which I remember a friend of mine said was a bad idea since this show in comparison would be bad.\n\nTo an extent he was right because truthfully it wasn’t nearly as good but at the same time I didn’t expect to be and I don’t think it really intended to be. I think there’s a misconception that every piece of media needs to be some revolutionary, ground-breaking story in order to be any good but I don’t think that’s true. I think a piece of media can be just as good (a\n\n...\n\n10/10 even) if it succeeds at being pure entertainment and by all means Blue Lock is exactly that.\n\nSports were never really my thing, I never hated them, I’d watch them if presented the opportunity but I never really understood or wanted to pursue my knowledge in that so there is a bit of a disconnect for me here since I have almost no interest in sports as it is.\n\nBut I would be lying if I was saying I still wasn’t hooked from every soccer match. For the matches I felt like I was genuinely in that match, the adrenaline from the players was also apart of me creating this sense of catharsis for every goal, every victory, and every defeat. One thing I adore about this show is the fact that both teams each have compelling enough characters + their motivations so I honestly go back and forth who I should root for. Every match has the right amount of drama and stakes, one wrong step and the dreams crumble down. The moves, weapons, strategies feel unique to each specific character, I couldn’t get enough. If nothing else, watch the show for the matches alone.\n\nAnother really, really good thing about this show is how different it feels from typical sports-genre stories. They’re like biopics in the sense it’s the same movie just with a different mc in their place. Blue Lock stands apart from most other sports stories, while it has the same theme of defining the meaning and passion of the sport, this story feels much more radical as opposed to the more wholesome stories. It’s a nice change of pace.\n\nThe characters are good enough to carry the show but feel relatively surface level which honestly I don’t mind since this show isn’t a study about complex morals or characters but still as a result the characters don’t really feel memorable as a result. However, like I said, they work for this show and I like how unique they feel even if somewhat one-note.\n\nThe episodes tend to feel formulaic but not in the good way. Obviously having a formula is okay but if, to me, I feel like I’m watching the same episode over and over again then it takes me out of the experience again. The second arc is better at than the first arc in this regard but still I felt that feeling creep in.\n\nEverything else in this show feels just right on a technical and writing level. There’s just enough substance to hook you in but not enough to want more. \n\nSo in that case you may wondering why it’s ranked relatively low. Truthfully I rank shows from a 60-40 system where (about) 40% of it is dedicated to the technical aspects with (about) 60% coming from the enjoyment factor. Part of the enjoyment factor is if I see myself yearning for more or see myself rewatching it and as mentioned, soccer isn’t really my thing and I while I’m definitely interested in a season 2 I’m not feining for it and I honestly don’t think about it much outside of watching it which is both a pro and a con about it.\n\nStill with that said, this is a really entertaining show and while it’s toward the bottom of the list for the animes I’ve enjoyed, it’s still a 7/10 meaning I believe it is a good show and I would recommend it and say it’s a good time just not something I see myself remembering it or going back to it. It’s definitely a “in-the-moment” kind of show where it’s not something you’ll be thinking about after watching it but while you’re watching it you’ll definitely be hooked.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MyNameIsMike (\n9\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 4, 2022\n\npika11\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (3/24 eps)\n\n It shows unrealistic part of actual football game. So its not my taste of anime. Since I love to watch and play football this anime doesn't shows realistic part of it. I won't recommend it to people who love playing and watching football games. \n\nThose who don't care sports part then you'll enjoy since it has nice animation, music, Shonen type epic moment and all those super attacks type of playstyle.\n\nSome characters are annoying especially I don't like MC and how his strength is portrayed. Like what is super spatial awareness and smell of goal, he can know when is goal is coming and from\n\n...\n\nwhom without looking anything. That's doesn't happens in real game. And most importantly how striker is defined like the best striker is the most egoist player that's stupid. Ego only takes your own team down. It is team game so it requires team player and chemistry not some egoist manic.\n\nAlso this show is striker focused show, it doesn't talk about any other position. \"Attacks wins you game defends wins you title\", this saying is all about real football game but here its all about attack and attack. One team consisting of 11 strikers, then how you gonna determine their strength if striker is goalie or defender that's not their strong suit. For that especially there are different player.\n\nwell so it is full of Shonen style football game anime, break your limit and win game no matter who opposition is since you are mc. So who likes such you gonna enjoy. But for real football lover its nightmare.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by pika11 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 3, 2025\n\ncaptainkunnka\n\nRecommended\n\n Main: Outstanding (9.0) / 10.\n\nThis category rates how well the anime accomplished what it set out to do and how well it fits into the genre. I'm rating this as outstanding. While not a perfect anime by a long-shot, what BlueLock attempts is to, unlike other sports media, fully lean into the emotional aspect of playing football. At the same time, it's much like Jujutsu-Kaisen which lives by the rule of cool. So, is it fantastic writing? No. Will it hype you up as you're watching it? Probably. It's a really cool balance of (sometimes) genuinely good character work and interactions, actually interesting social commentary\n\n...\n\non modern Japanese society, and aura moments that will sometimes hype you up, sometimes make you cringe so hard you just want to bite a wall.\n\nProblems arise in the later episodes, though. By now, we have a cast of characters we know. As such, there's a limited amount of stuff the show can do with them (sometimes having them \"evolve\" though it always felt hap-hazard to me), its only decision being to add new characters to the cast to keep things interesting. However, the last episodes have Isagi and his team confront his \"rival\" and his team, except we already know everyone from both teams as well as their abilities. As such, it feels almost like watching a Pokemon battle: Barou plays chops and hits for 30! Then we just carry on like nothing happened. While the other games in this season had an actual structure to them, the latter ones devolved into something far, far, far more boring.\n\nStory / Plot: Excellent (8.5) / 10.\n\nI'm not saying this is a Shakespearean drama, but I do find the set-up extremely interesting. The pacing is just slow enough during games to make you feel their length (or the situation on the field), yet quick enough to not bore you. The structure is basic, but effective. Isagi starts off quite weak, yet has insane potential and a power that revolves around thinking (so he can't just \"train\" it and it always leads to hype moments in clutch situations during games). Can you FEEL he's the protagonist? Yes, unapologetically so (to the point the side-characters will comment on it sometimes). Does he absolutely EARN every improvement he gained? Yes. The improvements are really well timed, too.\n\nNon-Plot: Outstanding (9.0) / 10.\n\nThere's lots of fun, small character interactions I liked a lot.\n\nFan-service Toleration: If I speak, I'm in big trouble / 10.\n\nLots of men if you're into that. And Chigiri if you're into... that.\n\nDialogue: Kinda Bad (4.5) / 10.\n\nExcerpt from my journal logs: \"STOP TALKING ABOUT DEVOURING OTHER MEN!!!\"\n\nIf I allowed myself to be more biased, I'd probably rate this as a 2/10. This anime has had some of the most painfully cringe lines I have ever had the misfortune of hearing. As I said, in the later episodes games devolve into Pokemon matches where each character does a move then fades into obscurity. Isagi then comments on that move (if you're lucky he just says \"wow, Barou did chops!\" but if he wants to be extra annoying he'll add something about chemical reactions, villains, devouring and so on, which are all stuff I'm fine with as a one-off analogy but to actually have it be a recurring TERM in this universe is fucking insane), the character has their \"I, too, am in this anime\" moment, and we carry on. Which, okay, I can tolerate as long as Isagi's protagonist energy far outweighs the filler side-character meat-riding. The problem is this simply doesn't happen as the show goes on. The annoying pseudo-banter between people (like people calling Zantetsu \"Baka-Zantetsu\" or Chigiri being called \"Princess\", the nicknames and banter in these moments feels forced as hell) is guaranteed to drive you insane at some point, and no number of cool Isagi scenes can fix that. This leads to both character moments and game moments feeling forced, and thus already a hard watch. Tacked on is then the constant rundowns and flashbacks to said already bad moments, which makes them even tougher to watch cause now we're seeing them twice.\n\nThe problem is BlueLock can actually deliver unironically killer lines when it wants to. Ego Jinpachi, Chigiri, Isagi all have their moments of brilliance and it makes me be able to forget the annoying bits. But not fully.\n\nThis was supposed to be Average (5.5), but I just remembered Rin exists. Minus 1.\n\nCharacters: Great (8.0) / 10.\n\nY'know what, I was going to bitch about how edgy and annoying some of the characters are, but I don't care. The good characters are genuinely good, the bad characters are so bad they're enjoyable to watch, and there's a very, very, very small number of them I actually disliked. I liked Ego Jinpachi a lot, wasn't crazy for Nagi at first but he grew on me as the episodes progressed, Chigiri was such a goddamn drama queen you just have to love him, Bachira was wonderful, Rin and Barou are such edge-lords you can't not have fun when they're on screen, and that's about it for the characters I have an opinion on. Isagi is my favourite main character in all of anime. I will not elaborate. Watch Episodes 5 and 18.\n\nVisuals: Bad (4.0) / 10.\n\nActually really good prior to Episode 7, then it all goes to shit. It didn't really diminish my enjoyment for the most part, but some plays you just cannot take seriously due to how ridiculous they look. Switching from reasonably OK hand-drawn to 3D CGI within a single scene was especially jarring. Honestly though, I didn't really mind as long as it was kept to these background moments.\n\nSound: Perfect (10.0) / 10.\n\nPerfect voice-acting, perfect music, perfect sound.\n\nEnjoyment: 8.25 / 10.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by captainkunnka (\n12\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 4, 2023\n\ntianbaozi\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (10/24 eps)\n\n I've watched a fair amount of sports anime, and I watched this one based off my friend's strong recommendation.

Every character needs to get a line in in the time it takes for the ball to be passed. Characters are always going above and beyond because they 'found it within themselves' because they've now tasted failure or been near defeat. And Ego? So annoying. He's there to be an antagonist for antagonist's sake.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by tianbaozi (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 14, 2023\n\nSunnyMax92\n\nRecommended\n\n They lost a star from 9 to 8, because the Japanese are an obstinate culture and they refuse to get voice actors that actually speak English.

Its base concept on which the entire show revolves around and within which it takes itself extremely seriously, youth soccer, simply isn't all that intense or all that dramatic. The setting wildly underwhelms as it is an entirely true, non-hyperbolic statement when I tell you that literally every single episode, 24 out of 24, takes place within the Blue Lock facility and after reaching said facility in the first episode, the characters literally never leave. The writing and manufactured drama have a very juvenile, blatantly aimed at teenagers kind of tone and never has\n\n...\n\nany meaningful stakes beyond simply winning or losing at soccer. Expect eye-roll-inducing lines such as an antagonistic rival player telling the main character \"You're just an NPC!\" that SCREAM \"We're trying really hard to make 14 year old boys think our show is cool\". Its run of the mill modern graphics and equally run of the mill modern voice acting, while not detrimental to the show, never do anything to distinguish themselves from its contemporaries, nor does the soundtrack.\n\nUltimately unless you really, really love soccer or if as far as you're concerned any shonen is automatically good, there's just no reason to watch Blue Lock. It isn't particularly good at ANYTHING. A score of 8+ here on MAL is WILD to me. That MUST be a very young crowd with low standards and/or recency bias, but this show is super overrated.\n\nOBJECTIVE RATING- 6-7\n\nPERSONAL ENJOYMENT RATING- 6.5\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by RyanSpring (\n182\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 6, 2022\n\nJames_Wade\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (9/24 eps)\n\n I kinda expected too much coz this is so hyped rn. Show could've been better but here's my take. \n\nFirst, it deserves credit for trying to be creative and doing a sports anime thats kinda different than the rest. At times, it does offer some excitement, and I like that it challenges the classic teamwork mentality. While Blue lock aims to be revolutional, it unfortunately ends up being ridiculous. The whole premise of a Nazi concentration camp-esque football camp is so fucking dumb. Somehow, Japan's okay with locking up 300 adolescents in a place with no real sunlight for the sake of an experiment. It's\n\n...\n\nsuppose to improve athletes, but only the highly-rated players get a proper meal meant for athletes. Take note that this isn't a fantasy show, so I find such details important. Other sports anime like Haikyuu and Diamond no Ace are still entertaining without being ridiculous. These two series were also good at slowly familiarizing the audience about the sport being portrayed. Nine episodes in Blue Lock and I have not gained any understanding nor interest on Soccer at all.\n\nThe worst thing in Blue Lock is that dialogues sound like they were written by a 14-year-old. It's fucking cringeworthy and all dialogues just feel uninspiring and unnecessarily long. Combine that with a set of boring characters with forced \"unique\" or edgy personalities. I couldn't find a character to cheer for at all. \n\nIf you liked Haikyuu or DnA, lower your expectation on this one. If you just want to watch soccer anime, Ao no Ashi S1 just finished and imo is a slightly better watch tho I won't call it amazing. If you really have lots of time and you wanna relate with World Cup fans, go ahead and watch this.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by James_Wade (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nArmoryFour\n\nNot Recommended\n\n I love the manga and that's why i hate how the second arc is animated, i have to say IT'S HORRIBLE.\n\nFirst arc is well animated, they should've done something similar.\n\nAND I HATE HOW THE AURA LOOKS LIKE ISAGI IS SMELLING BAD, Rin's aura too, i didn't hate the season overall, so you're probably wondering why 1 out of 10, Manga is extremely epic, so it's normal to expect Anime being even better or at least the same, but it is not\n\nSo i recommend you to read the manga, or not, i've seen people that liked the anime, this is just my opinion, i can be\n\n...\n\nwrong or biased by the manga, arc 1 was awesome in Anime, even better than in Manga i would say.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ArmoryFour (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 21, 2023\n\nShinObi-Wan\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Numbness like a ginger. That’s how I feel about this one.\n\nI watched this because I have Crunchroll. And unfortunately, it seems that if there is ever an anime I want to watch, it’s not on Crunchyroll. Sports isn’t my genre; it’s actually my least favorite genre. But it was, however, on Crunchyroll.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the first episode. It ended with a twist that turned shounen on its head. And again, this is a sports anime, so all for one and one for all isn’t just a trope, it’s the core principal. The episode was spent building up the importance of the secondary\n\n...\n\ncharacter; and then immediately tossed him away forever. It was compelling!\n\nNothing really topped that moment, but the first 11 episodes were fresh. The problem became that it wasn’t sustainable, and it reverted back to just being a sports anime. And sports anime are boring. The show became less about ego maniacs in a pressure cooker, and more about adding super powers to one’s growing repertoire.\n\nTeam V was the best soccer team; they were unbeatable. But after Team V was vanquished, it turned out that there was a Big 3 we didn’t know existed. The Big 3 were actually the best. Oh, but then there’s the World 5. But before we get to the World 5, there’s still the 3rd selection and the Japanese U-20. Yeah, the same plot line of every generic shounen anime.\n\nI think that if this show stayed true to its egomaniac pressure cooker self, it might have become the second good sports anime: the anti-Haikyuu. \n\nIt didn’t; but it was on Crunchroll.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ShinObi-Wan (\n12\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nPrevious\n - \nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

None. Blue Lock is one of the most overhyped garbage this season. After watching 5 episodes of it, I saw the real reason why it has so many fans, \"Fujoshi Bait.\" Typical strategy of authors when they can't write a good story so they rely on the yaoi shippers instead to make their works popular, making their characters do some loving-loving hug and blush, naked scenes and spoon feeding. For blue lock fans, \"good looking characters = peak fiction\". Lol \n\nSo everyone asks, \"Is blue lock good?\" No it's not. If this is your definition of \"good\", then your taste is trash\n\n...\n\nI swear. Sports animes are so fvcked up nowadays. Imagine dirtying football like this, I'm embarrassed. \n\nDon't believe on die hard fans saying, \n\n\"oh it's good and I don't even like football\" \n\n\"best sports anime ever\"\n\nClowns. I'm one of the victims of these lies from them because i ended up watching this only to regret with a headache. \n\nCharacters are all overpowered. They keep trying hard to make Isagi look weak and incomplete when the truth is he's already overpowered, can use his bird's eye perfectly and playmaking is already easy for him. And the thought that they have no coach to teach them...bruh what kind of magic is this? This anime should have fantasy tag.\n\nRepetitive. All events in this anime is repetitive, doing the same thing over and over, well there's nothing they can do because the entire setting is only in the facility and the field. So the cycle of them going in and playing only repeats.\n\nCarried by animation. Do people only care about animations now? Wth. Look, good animation is important, but how can you ignore the trash plot, trash characters and trash storyline? Wow, your tolerance to stvpidity is almost admirable. \n\nTrash Dialogues. Literally. Blue lock is trying soo hard to look cool but always ends up cringe, corny, and childish. They are bunch of brats without vocabulary.\n\nMusic and OST is a mess. Sports animes is known for having great music and osts. But blue lock doesn't have one. All bad. OP & ED is bad, OST is bad. \n\nHorrible, unrealistic and a waste of time. Blue Lock is an abomination.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by _eraserhead_ (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 6, 2022\n\nPY3\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (5/24 eps)\n\n Okay wow, the heck did this one get an 8.0+ rating? Such a massive fan of the manga, But this anime adaptation can't even be called \"mid\". It is such a shame how poorly directed this adaptation is.\n\nThe pacing is so fked. Haikyuu for example, though completely different sports, The pacing made it still feel smooth even though they are still talking mid-game. I don't think they did their homework of actually watching a real football game cause of how awkward they made them look when they were on the field. \n\nI don't actually mind the 3d in this. The animation is fine but in\n\n...\n\nsome scenes, the movement is off and felt very stiff.\n\nI personally don't care bout Blue Lock's story or plot, I read the weekly chapters to feel excited, and curious about what is going to happen next, but they fell to deliver that cause of how they completely ruined pacing. I've re-read the manga and It still keeps me excited, but watching this anime pisses me off. Such a wasted opportunity.\n\nI don't want to be that guy, and I know you guys are tired of hearing this but JUST READ THE MANGA.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by PY3 (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2023\n\nMcsuper\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Blue Lock is a sports series where some of your normal sports anime tropes aren’t present, especially the “power of friendship”, which is good in a way, yet it made it so edgy to the point where sometimes, it’s quite laughable. If you’re someone who likes sports anime for its realism, you won’t get that here at all. It’s definitely quite epic at times, and there are a couple unpredictable moments mixed in there, but I feel like the appeal of sports anime in general is to have a good mix of humour and drama, while being very character driven and relatable to the viewer\n\n...\n\nat times. With how gimmicky the characters tend to be, it was hard to resonate with any of them, or the plot in general. For me, it was mostly just a popcorn shounen show, that didn’t leave me with much to take away other than some hype moments.\n\nThe premise is quite interesting, as the Japan Football Union created this project called Blue Lock, who would select three hundred U-18 strikers into their program, and pit them against each other to rise to the top. In a sense, I thought it’d be like a death game anime, where if you fail, you would die, and this show sort of has that identity of being that way, as expulsion from Blue Lock is virtually the end of one’s pro soccer aspirations. \n\nWhile soccer is generally considered a team sport, Blue Lock separates itself from other sports anime, as it focuses on selfishness and ego, rather than trying to build teamwork and good relations with teammates. While that seems like a novel concept, to me, it has a major drawback. Since character development is one of the most important things in sports shows in my opinion, the lack of team building and cohesion makes it so the characters aren’t that memorable, and they’re more gimmicky than anything, with each character having their unique part of the game that they’re good at, whether it’s vision of the field, speed, shooting, or handling the ball well. The character interactions for the most part, don’t tell us much about each character besides their surface personality. In fact, most of the characters don’t even develop properly, and have zero backstory to them. Without meaningful character interactions, it was difficult for me to really empathize with any of the characters. Their aspirations beyond being the “best striker” is all they want to do, so most of them have nothing that separates them from others aside from their gimmick.\n\nThe animation and art in Blue Lock is not all that great in my opinion. Some of the movement during the games was very stiff, especially during the second cour of the show, where I think the studio just rushed through production. The CGI was quite ugly at times when it was shown as well. As for the character designs, they scream like edgy teens. The eyes were extremely cringy to me especially, but I suppose the edginess is what makes this show special to people.\n\nThe music was middling as well, as the soundtrack wasn’t all that standout. The first ED and second OP were good, but the OP and ED by Unison Square Garden just wasn’t all that impressive. \n\nAs for my enjoyment throughout the show, I thought it had quite an unimpressive first half, and then the story improved towards the end of the series. It’s unfortunate that the animation degraded as the second half went along, or else I would have had a more favourable impression of this show overall.\n\nOverall, Blue Lock is a fine show, despite all my criticisms. It can be quite exhilarating to watch sometimes, in the big moments, but the edgy dialogue and humour wasn’t all that great. The characters are quite weak overall, while the story was up and down. One thing I found funny was that the 2022 World Cup happened during the airing of this anime, because I felt it unintentionally promoted this show a bit more.\n\nThe main message here is just don’t expect a realistic portrayal of sports, you won’t get it in this anime.

They are told multiple times to only have their own interests in mind and to stop at nothing to become the best. If it helps their growth, they should sell their own grandma.\n\nNo buddy-buddy with your teammates, goody-two-shoes get left behind, and betrayal is part of the game.\n\nThe whole facility is designed to provide the best training technology can offer, only to produce one singular world-class striker. I\n\n...\n\nhave no idea who funds the project, but it seems a bit wasteful. That is pretty much the plot of Blue Lock.\n\nNow, if you get past that first glance and watch a few more episodes, you can see the established sports anime formula crawling back in and making itself at home.\n\nSoon you find yourself surrounded by characters that have the same personality traits as many others from this genre.\n\nThe main guy, Isagi Yoichi, doesn't alleviate that problem either.\n\nFirst, he always seems shaken to the core when someone else has only their own interests in mind and pursues those ambitions ruthlessly.\n\nSecond, the studio decided it would be a good idea to make him sound desperate and on the verge of tears whenever he is in a tough spot. It is exhausting.\n\nThird, Yoichi never looks bad in the eyes of the viewer. Whenever he is faced with a hard choice that might smear his good boy persona, he receives a helping hand from the author to avoid unpleasant situations. \n\nIt is always others who make decisions for him, Yoichi never steps on any toes. Even if someone's dream of becoming the best striker is crushed, it is perfectly set up in a way that you can hardly blame our protagonist for it because the other guy knew the risks and took the initiative.\n\nMy main gripe with Blue Lock was the pacing. Or rather, the lack of it. Especially the later episodes, but it is also apparent in the earlier ones, are filled with nonstop unneeded talking.\n\nIt wouldn't be half bad if the writers actually sat down and put some effort into writing compelling dialogue, but they decided to just ignore that important step.\n\nMatches are filled with constant over-explanations of players' thought processes. Every single move and tactic is laid out, examined and explained until all the momentum of the action on-screen is lost and dead. Also, it is beyond tiresome if all of the characters have to go through an existential crisis, or multiple ones, in every single episode.\n\nEven if they are in the middle of the game, with only one minute left on the clock, they find some time to have a monologue or a little chitchat with the other guys on the field. Thankfully, most of the players abide by battle shounen rules and don't interrupt our main guy while he is lost in thought. They let him hold the ball until he is finished thinking.\n\nI think it wouldn't be too far-fetched if I said that more than half of an episode's runtime is spent repeating the same dialogue and thoughts Yoichi and his friends have. It is an inescapable loop.\n\nIt seems like the studio doesn't have a high opinion of its viewers and thinks they need this nonstop word vomit because football/soccer is an alien sport.\n\nBesides giving everyone that weird, exaggerated grin and spirally eyes, the anime looks solid. Art and animation are definitely the strong points of this show, with some good colors and flashy effects.\n\nEven though they sprinkle in some CGI and as you get closer to the final few episodes, you can tell the budget got tighter. Close-ups, less fluidity in the animation, static shots with minimal character movement and other ways to save some money.\n\nTo wrap it all up, the story of the first few episodes seemed promising compared to other sports anime. Sadly, the anime loses its steam rather quickly story-wise and blunders the narrative. Art and animation hold their own and make Blue Lock entertaining for a bit, but are unable to fill the holes that the lacking parts left.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Huskkay (\n14\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 22, 2022\n\nsnowbae\n\nMixed Feelings\nPreliminary\n\n (3/24 eps)\n\n \"CARRIED BY ANIMATION\" \n\nYes. Blue Lock is literally a sports series who can only offer good animation and good looking characters. Now, that's not totally a bad thing cuz I, myself is a sucker for animanga with good looking and all boys characters whom I can ship with each other.\n\nBUT! As a fan of sports animes, I hate those who can't even represent the sports properly. Although I don't play sports, I highly respect each of them and I despise those who makes them look ridiculous and stupid.\n\nStory (4): Maybe you think it's too early for me to give a review when the anime is\n\n...\n\njust starting, but I already read the manga so I already know what's gonna happen. Blue Lock's concept is kinda fun... but hella weird and hella cringe. Broo I'm getting second hand embarrassment all the time because of the dialogues and overreacting expressions and voices. Plus all that monster like shadows ruined everything for me. It's not football, it's pure fantasy. Also, you probably know what each and everyone of them wanted to achieve right? That is, \"To be the best striker in the world.\" Lmao. They don't care about the other positions, they act like strikers are the only important position in football. It's so stupid. \n\nCharacters (5): Do they have good looks? Yes! They are all boys, all gorgeous and I love it. But do they have interesting personalities? Nah. They all the same, act the same and talk the same. They are so childish and self-centered. They lack character depth and personality. What exactly is their goal in life?? To be the best striker? That's it? Tf. \n\nArt & Animation (8): Even though I hate the story and the characters, the art and animation quality is indeed good. But there are still bad parts where animation is like slideshow and stiff. Some scenes are ruined too because of the animation, and pacing is weird in the anime.\n\nMusic(3): Blue Lock music is bad. OP and ED is bad, voices of the characters are bad so as the osts\n\nEnjoyment(4): The animation is good so it's good in the eyes too. I'm fine as long as the characters don't talk. I honestly wish they don't talk forever but that's not gonna happen so... yeah. We have to deal with it. \n\nOverall (4): It's new, that's true. But \"new\" doesn't always equals to \"good\". The story and football aspect of this anime sucks. They play football not because they love it but because they just want to. You get what I mean? They kick and run but THEY DON'T HAVE PASSION for the sport ugh. I hate that.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by snowbae (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nPrevious\n - \n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

They've got all kinds of nice stuff going on, beautiful delicious soft serve vanilla bean ice cream, some hot fudge, freshly cracked up peanuts, woah what is that?? A brownie? Some delicious house made whipped cream... Man this sundae is gonna be spectacular. Wow what more could you ask for? Cherry on top? Bring it on!!\nAnd then all of a sudden they put an anchovy on top, and then another, and then a couple more, and then squirt some Dijon mustard on for good measure.\nYou don't even want the sundae anymore, in fact, you can't even look back on how nice that sundae used to be without thinking about all the stupid s*** they did at the very end just when it was going so well.\nThat's essentially Game of Thrones. I tried to rewatch it, but as I got through the first season I began looking at where all the pieces land at the end it's literally impossible to go back to. There are just so many ruined character arcs, so much pointlessness, and every time I come back here I drop it one more star it seems like. Game of Thrones is a beautiful anchovy sundae.\nkunkell\nNov 1, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nFantastic, until the final season\nSpoiler\nthelatestdionne\nMay 29, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nSeasons 1 - 5 are incredible and it devolves from there...\nThe period where the TV show follows the books are really incredible, but beyond that point they've gone \"Hollywood\" and used all the old TV tropes, the lack of which made the first five seasons so refreshing.\ncampsbayrich\nMay 12, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nGame of Retcons\nGame of Thrones will go down in history as the greatest decline in writing quality of all time.\nI used to love this show, the story, characters, the sprawling setting. It's one of the first series that really made me care and root for the characters. Even the irredeemably evil ones were still exciting to watch.\nBut that all changed with the final season. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past year, its commonly known that George RR Martin has not released his final book of the franchise. The final two seasons were all HBO original content, and they could maintain the story in passable quality during the seventh season. However, when it came to ending the story it is rushed, anticlimactic, and immeasurably disappointing.\nCharacters started acting stupid, or just entirely unlike themselves. Loved heroes become confusingly insane, they lost all semblance of motivations from past seasons and suddenly became totally different people. The writer's excuse? A new motivation from past seasons is written in to skip development, in other words, retcons galore.\nThe dialogue became inanely simplistic or just repetitive and boring. So little of importance is ever said. Characters just stare off in the distance vacantly, then occasionally they make the most observances that anyone could have inferred on their own. What happened to the complex script full of setups, payoffs, and humanly written characters?\nThe only thing left to do now is scrub the awful ending out of my head by rewatching the past six seasons. Then I'll wait for George RR Martin to release the true ending because this is an absolute disgrace. D&D spit in the faces of millions of GOT fans. The best recommendation I can give this show is to watch the first six seasons (and the seventh if you want to test your patience) then forget about season eight.\nRebelPanda\nMay 13, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nBig potential, but poor finish...\nFeel devastated after final episide, everything for nothing....\nadiwro\nMay 29, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nMaybe the best TV show with the worst final season ever\nI'll be short:\nseason 1-5 : vote 10\nseason 6 : vote 8\nseason 7 : vote 5\nseason 8 : vote 2\nWithout Martin books, last 3 seasons started the descent into the abyss.\nPoor screenplay, awful dialogues, plot armors, plot holes, all characters have a regression, internal inconsistencies, incompetence in military matters.\nDisrespectful to the public and the author.\nI bet the actors will show their disappointment in the future.\nI really don't know if i'd recommend it\ngmagius\nMay 29, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nStarted good went nowhere\nSpoiler\nmanalexander\nMay 5, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nGreat book and series, terrible final season\nThe critique is not to do with the final fates of character. Instead it's with the overall production of the final season. It's as if they changed directors, editors, and writers. Season 8 had novice filming mistakes, timing and overall all flown issues. It was a gravely disappointing end product. We're all left to day dream how we'd have done it differently. Now if George R. R. Martin would ever get to finishing the written series, we might get a consistent to the text, quality ending. Please finish. Mr. Martin. Please.\nllamsrjsrm\nMay 20, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nCompletely fizzled out...\nStarted excellently and got better but completely baffled by the final season.\nSo much time and effort put into creating and building interesting and exciting characters only to see their stories end in the most unimaginable ways.

I can't understand that someone develops characters for 6-7 seasons and then destroys them completely. So sad...\ntamimijatovic\nMay 12, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nA once amazing show ruined by it's ending\nThis show is absolutely stunning. It contains some of the most well fleshed out characters and plotlines ever written, containing gripping plot twists and unmatched character dialogue. However, this is not true for the entire series. Seasons 1-6 are incredibly written and acted, and remain the pinnacle of modern television. Season 7, while still great, is just that. Fabulous and entertaining, yet not golden. The final season and it's ending, however, have ruined the show, and will leave you feeling utterly disappointed and dismassed.\nWhile previous seasons have featured stunning plot points and made revolutionary contributions to modern storytelling, the final season and it's conclusion lacks any semblance of these previous seasons, ignoring seasons of character development, illogical plotlines, and absurd dialogue. The whole season feels so out of place and nonsensical that it tarnishes the legacy of Game of Thrones. After seventy-odd episodes of epic build-up, Game of Thrones is a frustrating let down with a poorly written conclusion. Plotlines built up over seven seasons vanish with no payoff, and characters you are so vested in suddenly lose their multi-faceted layers of development in a confusingly written mess. Because of this, I sadly recommend avoiding the series completely.\njames-a-durrell\nMay 19, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nSeason 8 is garbage\nThe writing is terrible, the show is rushed. They made Arya Stark the main character of this season and she is on of the worst characters on the show. They need to restart this season.\ndoobie-39565\nMay 12, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nAmazing tv show with a horrible and lazy ending\nThe tv show is one of the best series ever made but as time went by they rushed to finish it as fast as they can and ruined a lot of characters along the way. Shame that the fans are so disrespected after years of tremendeous support. It was a 9/10 for me before the last season and many would give it less than my 6/10 after this season but I think it is still worth a watch.\ndanielpetrovic-99358\nMay 12, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nFirst impressions aren't everything\nWhile it starts off excellent and full of potential it quickly loses steam due to some lazy derivative writing would recommend it but there are better fantasy alternatives out there\nHowever I'll compliment the great acting and production values\nmouhamedlaminos\nMay 6, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nEnding on a stumble\nSpoiler\nsamtorreslpn\nMay 19, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nWhat were you thinking?\nSpoiler\noldupai\nApr 29, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nSeriously???\nSpoiler\nchrisjijon\nMay 16, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nWinter is coming\nSpoiler\nlotus-31549\nApr 30, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nGame of Thrones is Over....\nWell, it's over. This review is spoiler-free.\nI spent almost a decade with Game of Thrones. I have seen the first few seasons 5 or 6 times.\nIf you are the type of viewer that enjoys the ride, and you don't really care where it is taking you, then Game of Thrones is a10/10.\nIt has some of the best production quality, acting, and cinematography not just on the small screen, but in all of cinema.\nHowever, it does not stick the landing.\nSeasons 7 and 8 are very rushed and poorly written resulting in a whimpering finale that leaves dozens of plot holes unfilled while also leaving a dry, poor taste in your mouth.\nI'm not exaggerating. DOZENS of plots are simply forgotten. The most interesting things in the show mean nothing at all. The intrigue goes nowhere. You can ignore at least 75% of the interesting lore and characters, since they mean absolutely nothing.\nBut, it LOOKS amazing, which is why it gets a 6.\nAlso, if you are a student of acting, all of the actors and actresses are really spot-on, and the sound and music are unparalleled.\nOverall, Game of Thrones is a massive disappointment. It will go down as one of the most controversial and divisive series of all time. Its last two seasons are incomprehensibly rushed, and those seasons betray almost every theme and plot that the books spent decades refining.\nEven after all that, it is quite a journey getting there. If that's what interests you, then I cautiously recommend Game of Thrones with a warning that it has very little payoff.\nEdbechill\nMay 21, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nSeason 1-7 is 10/10 season 8 ruined the show\nMaybe the best show in human history untill season 8 where the storywriting is just, well it is so bad im speechless.\nI really hope we sometime in the future get the last season remade.\nlovedoll84\nMay 12, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nSeason 8\nWe have really enjoyed GoT since its first episode, have just watched the episode 3 from season 8, to be honest I was very disappointed, to say the episode cost over 11 million to make, the whole episode was so dark you couldn't make out what was happening.

Mainly because of my impatience as a viewer. I get so involved, that I have to fuel the fire all at once. Eight years in the making, the suspense was. Boy, let me tell you, the imagination was surpassed ten fold when I actually started the series. It was a bit slow to begin with, though once it took flight, it soared. The writing, character development, portrayal, and the wonder. Astonishing. Unfortunately, the series stumbled, then tripped. The swan dive was horrifying. Such potential ripped from the very soul of the once beautiful masterpiece. With no effort really. All by just the last two episodes. It pains me to have to leave such a terrible review. A 6/10 is actually a bit courteous. I feel sorry for those that followed from day one with such patience. Maybe reading the books will make something better.\nnmr-user\nMay 19, 2019\nPermalink\n6\n/\n10\nSeason 8 almost sunk the series\nFor a long while now I've considered this show my favorite series. Season 1-7 were wonderful, full of epic cinematic scenes, inspired acting, and fantastic writing. Season 8 on the other hand, while still possessing the cinematic and acting (for the most part), severely lacks in the writing department. Dan and Dave seemed to have gotten the Disney project and said, \"Game of Thrones who, eh just pump something out quick they'll watch it anyway\".

The sets, characters, pacing, twists - exceptional. I could not fault it, however, after that things went downhill.\nWhen it came to Season 5, the author of the books (George R. R. Martin) and HBO had a disagreement. Martin wanted the show to run across more series, to give all his complex story lines the chance to grow & move at a natural pace. HBO declined and so he dropped off the project, which is extremely evident.\nSeason 6 & 7, although flawed, were still watchable. The books & George's earlier comments paved the way for both seasons, but you could feel that the episodes lacked substance.\nThis brings us to the latest season, and after 2 years of waiting expectations were very high. The first two episodes were very plain, the reunions were wonderful, however you could tell they were setting up for one of the biggest fights of the series, which had been greatly anticipated since Season 1. I tried to not to have too high of expectations, however the director referred to episode 3 as \"bigger than Helms Deep\" which is a comment that will always spark excitement.\nEpisode 3 was so utterly disappointing, in every way. If you were somehow able to see through the intense darkness (what was the director thinking?) you will crumble to the poor decisions made by writers. I will not stem into this too much, but basically Dan & Dave chose to go down the Hollywood path, completely disregarding any real story or strategy. Episode 4 was equally as disappointing, which I was hoping would redeem the final season.\nThe writers have ruined this final season by fast tracking characters (basically teleporting), making the smartest of characters docile, and letting plot armor protect 'favorites'. I am still going to watch until the end, but I thought I would warn any future viewer to prepare yourself, as there is nothing more heartbreaking than watching terrible writing ruin a otherwise tremendous series.\njules-37803\nMay 6, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nBest show turned disaster.\nAs GoT started, the first four seasons were insanely great. The story, the characters, the mature plot points. Everything was just perfect. It was 11/10 for me then.\nBut as the seasons passed and episodes increased, the show became dumber and dumber and dumber. The story became childish, and the premise deteriorated. And now in season 8, it feels like a bunch of kindergarten kids are given the task of writing the plot for this show.\ndebanjanpaul-83967\nMay 9, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nShame of Thrones\nThe ending of this series is a disservice to the public!\nThe first seasons are great as they are based on the books source material and, apparently, the writers are good enough at adapting other people ideas. After season four there's a decline, not so manifest at first since the goodness of the source material still lingers around. It's more of a slow deterioration, a spiral into shallow writing that peaks in a last season devoid of content and value.\nWhere at first grand scale developments, societal issues and world-spanning intrigues dominated the narration with characters being the pawns of the true overarching story, later in the seasons characters and stereotypical interactions take the stage and the interesting, long developing issues that made the story captivating get resolved in the most unrewarding ways possible. It's incoherent, detached, uninspired writing. It's everything that is bad in mainstream media.\nAll of this because the writers decided they had enough with the show and grew bored with it. So they wanted to wrap it up as soon as possible in order to go on and ruin the Star Wars franchise (more than it already is). Thanks for your disservice!\nIt needs to be mentioned that the overall production, sound design, acting, cinematography, all of these are quite extraordinary and elevate the show quite a bit, even when the writing declines. The quality is amazing. It probably is still worth watching for its entertainment value. It just doesn't pay off. The ending season ruins quite literally everything.\ntype-a1pha\nMay 23, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nPerfect then ruined\nI had read the books years before the series came out and was a bit dubious about how it would translate to the screen. I then saw HBO were doing it which eased my worries as they make some superb programmes, and when I finally got to watch it, it is superb from the first scene.\nExcellent casting, acting and staying close to the books this was the best programme on TV for years!\nThe problem is the series overtook the books and since then it has gone downhill, especially the final series. There is a massive battle which should be incredible but I found it a real let down, and the episodes after this are even worse. These characters that have been so well developed over the years suddenly act in ways that are just bizarre, I'm incredibly disappointed, I doubt George R R Martin had much to do with the scripts/plot and I'm sure he can't be happy with the result. 10/10 for the first few seasons, 3/10 for the last one.\nThere were also a couple of things in the previous season which were a big letdown, like explaining where the bad guys came from, and some characters were massively underused, or their story arc just seemed to tail off when the had been so promising.\nOverall definitely worth watching but prepare yourself for disappointment towards the end.\ndmgaskell-12765\nMay 16, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\n8 years for this\nMaybe just watch it up to season 6 then think of how you'd like the series to end. Would be more enjoyable if they didn't do such a terrible job ending the series.\naaronongtw\nMay 22, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nMeme of Thrones\nThis series had the potential to become something truly great by the end and open a new chapter in the world of television. Sadly, the eighth season completely ruined the whole series, including its characters, its world and its story.\nI won't mention any spoilers here, but if you really want to watch this series, be prepared for a gigantic disappointment at the journey's end. You'll watch one of the greatest series burn down in huge flames.\nIf I have to rate each seasons individually, here's how I would rank them:\nSeason 1-4: These are definitely the most complex, most layered seasons with the highest level of scriptwriting. Excellent dialogues, pacing, character developments, narrative twists, etc. Mainly because at this time the writer of the books was still involved in the making of the series and the series were heavily build upon the books. The absolute best is Season 4 because it had the best character interactions and story arcs and it also had some of the most memorable moments in the series.\nSeason 5 is a mixed bag. It has the heavily disliked Dorne plotline and overall, most episodes in it while are okay, they don't move the story forward in any meaningful way, they often just feel like fillers. But at the same time, the last four episodes are extremely good and interesting, mainly Hardhome, which is arguably one of the best episodes in the series (and also my personal favourite along with the ninth episode of the sixth season).\nSeason 6 is fantastic and in some ways, it's maybe the best along with Season 4. But it's hard to properly judge it, because despite some of its darker moments, it feels rather optimistic and uplifting, and maybe because of it, for some people, it won't really feel like Game of Thrones. But everything that happens in this season happens for a reason and everything is earned, twists and moments don't feel cheap or forced, they feel natural, there are no filler episodes and the overall pacing is great.\nSeason 7 is a mixed bag, similarly to Season 5. One half of it is great, the other half is not so much. But as opposed to Season 5, in this case, the first half (first three episodes) are the good ones, and the later episodes are the bad ones. The first three episodes are very dialogue-heavy and character-centric and they feel very well written and satisfying, they feel a natural continuation of the story and quality of Season 6. But after that, the logic gets completely thrown out of the window, everything starts to happen so fast and basically, Game of Thrones' real downfall starts from here.\nSeason 8 is a monumental disappointment. It subverts your expectations in the worst possible ways, things happen purely for shock value instead of happening because of the natural progression of the story. Character arcs get thrown completely out of the window, there are tons of deus ex machina moments, main characters wear plot armor and they are practically invincible. Things happen way too fast therefore there isn't enough time to really build up certain scenes in an intelligent and beleivable manner and scenes that are supposed evoke a certain feeling from the viewers (for example, sadness) evoke a totally different feeling instead (they make the viewers laugh). There are a lot of forced and artificial drama, the episodes are extremely inconsistent in a lot of ways, not just compared to the previous' seasons episodes, but compared only to other Season 8 episodes too. The biggest victim of Season 8 is Game of Thrones itself.\ndaemonxhun\nMay 13, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nFinal Season ruined it\nWhat else can I say. They should have dragged it out to build the suspense and come up with some better ideas to end it.\ngswms\nMay 27, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nTrainwreck\nFirst four seasons are ten out of ten. Particular thing that happens in season four finale, turns out to be the one that Game of Thrones died with too. Because, even if seasons five and six have excellent moments, they also lack The Moments, not even going to enter discussing quality of dialogue territory, which obviously dropped. Then, season seven that is good, but fewer than few actually make sense, including decisions that most characters make. Plot is nonsensical, and season is shorter. Fast Travel engaged. And then...\nGlorious season eight..., absolute disaster.

And this used to be true. GoT used to be one of the best shows the world had ever seen. Complex, interesting characters and plotlines in a rich, detailed world. It used to for around five seasons.\nThis show has changed and while I didn't mind (even as season seven became downright ridiculous), I didn't mind for a reason.\nGame of Thrones had the chance to reveal something deep, something meaningful and humble about the world we live in, about power and about sacrifice. The way it was crafted was designed to climax in a finale that would hold a revelation inside. Something to take away.\nNow, as the last season airs, this possibility has faded. It's spectacle and it looks as good as a few hundred million dollars can look on-screen. But the story it tells is not longer important. It has become the antithesis of what it opposed. Generic high-action fantasy. I highly encourage everyone to watch the first few seasons of this show, they are some of the best television ever made, including some of the best performances of our time. And if you have seen them, you will want to see the last three seasons too. And at first, you will notice small things, but they don't matter that much. But these things eventually become big and blatant and the question the books may answer in the end? They don't matter.\nI have seen more complex Youtube videos theorizing about this show becasue, early on, you could do that. Little things meant a lot and details would become major themes. You can still do this now, but the fact of it is, that the writers don't put as many effort in the scripts as the people imagining the impossible. Most theories are based around the fact that this show used to be everything but generic. Everything could happen. Now, it has become generic. And things just... kinda happen. It hurts to rate something this way that used to be better than the most. But we have been spoiled with good TV in the last years and GoT doesn't compare to things like Breaking Bad anymore. Even though I wish it did.\nnilsbrandstaedter\nApr 28, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nBest show, worst finale\nOne of the best series ever with the worst final ever.\nlucaspachecodg\nMay 21, 2019\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nPost-Book Seasons (6,7,8) Destroyed Everything what Initially Made GoT So Great\nHard to express how disappointed I am about the post-season development of the show.

Its like you came to know that you were in love with the wrong one all along. It was like looking at a completely different person. It was like seeing your own dreams and expectations get destroyed. It was not a let down, it was a BETRAYAL!\nsamxxx-671-826221\nMay 24, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nSeasons 1-6: outstanding. 7: daft but good. 8: disappointing\nLet's say you're reading these reviews and haven't watched GoT yet, but now that it's finished are considering the marathon. What's the consensus? In this case, the consensus is accurate, and that is:\nSeasons 1-6: outstanding. Deep world-building, intelligent dialogue, epic set-pieces worthy of Hollywood, expert acting, detailed plotting, genuine surprises, great soundtrack used sparingly. GoT is worth watching for these seasons, definitely.\nSeason 7: you suddenly notice the writing and plotting has taken a sharp dive downwards in quality. There are inexplicable ideas, inconsistent characterisation and soap-opera dramas. But at least the entertainment value is still very high, so it gets a pass.\nSeason 8: this drop chasms down to depths you didn't think possible. The writing has got so amateurish that the still-fantastic production values are no longer enough to save it. If you ever enjoyed Lost but were amazed at how bad the final season was, you're in familiar territory here.\nThe biggest problem with the final season was it took us out of the story and got us thinking about its many weaknesses. We lost our suspension of disbelief. Fatal for fiction. It also ruined the series-arcs to the point where a rewatch of the entire series is pointless.\nSo can I recommend a GoT marathon for newcomers? Yes, the first 6 seasons are worth the disappointments later on. But best series of all time it is not. It could've been, but dropping the ball in the final stretch puts it behind the following superior series more worthy of your marathon:\nBattlestar Galactica (2003-2008)\nTwin Peaks (all 3 seasons, plus the movie)\nBreaking Bad\nslowcando\nMay 20, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nWhy just why?

It's common knowledge. For the people who haven't yet seen it, is it worth it to watch anyways?\nWell, yes and no. I would definitely say for most you can still enjoy the majority of the show. However, if you are the type of person that values the destination MORE than the journey, I would be cautious.\nSeasons 1-4: 10/10\nSeasons 5-6: 9/10\nSeason 7: 7/10\nSeason 8: 3/10\nSeasons 1-6 have some of my favorite moments in storytelling, ever. If you are a fan of intense, gritty realism, intriguing plot, and complex characters, I would definitely still recommend this show, just know what you're getting yourself into.\nMY WARNING TO THOSE STARTING: DO NOT get too emotionally attached to the show. Enjoy it for its quality alone, and understand WHY the last 2 seasons are not as good. This way you will not be depressed for weeks on end after watching the last season like I was.\nLet this show be the prime example of how a show goes from some of the most compelling narratives I've ever seen, to absolute trash at the end. From a purely analytical standpoint it is quite fascinating to watch.\nalih765\nMay 21, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nFantasy has never seemed so real\nI don't believe there has ever been anything like 'Game of Thrones' on TV. The sheer amount of quality and talent in this series is staggering. The actors (and I mean really ALL the actors), the costumes, the visual effects, the make-up: everybody working on this show seems to have wanted to make Television-history. And the writing is just phenomenal.\n'Game of Thrones' may belong to the 'Fantasy' genre, but the world of Westeros and its surrounding lands has been so amazingly well thought through and is inhabited by characters that are so well drawn and credible that everything you watch feels real. Every \"country\", every city, tribe or family has such a richly detailed history and even mythology that it just never feels like it was made up. Of course, that was all already there in the books – but translating that so perfectly to a TV-show and with such care as was done here really is a rare achievement.\nYet for all its grandeur, scale and breath-taking visuals, what really makes Martin's outstanding work come to life on the small screen is the fantastic ensemble of actors. At the core of this show (any show, really) are the characters. Tyrion, Cersei, Dany, Jamie and John (and all the – many – others) don't lose anything of their complexity; the amazing cast succeeds in showing all their respective characters' inner conflicts and often questionable motivations and virtually no one comes across as one-dimensional (except maybe for Joffrey).\nThere have been a couple of great TV-shows over the last years, but when it comes to scale AND quality, 'Game of Thrones' is – at the moment – in a league of its own. A joy to watch: breath-taking, epic – and highly addictive – Television. 10 stars out of 10.\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\nFavorite Films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/\ngogoschka-1\nJul 21, 2014\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nSeason 7 and 8 ruined the series\nSpoiler\nbrianapeyton\nMay 13, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nthe best TV show in history\nAn epic series, most of the actors mastered their characters despite the bad season, that it is still the best TV show in history\nauuwws\nJun 2, 2020\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nexcellent but ruined by the end\nI would have scored it with a 10 if the end had not treated the best characters so disrespectfully.

Season 7-8: WHY\nI just recently rewatched the series because my husband had never seen Game of Thrones. I wanted to watch HOTD and he was feeling left out, so I decided we should get him into GOT so he would understand more when watching HOTD. So we binged seasons 1-8. And all this did for me was remind me how angry I am with what they did. Just why? There's nothing I can say that every other review hasn't said, I just needed somewhere to put these words. Knowing how everything ends and ends so abruptly with no storytelling - which becomes even more painfully obvious when you binge everything in a 3 week timeframe, just makes all the earlier seasons almost not even worth rewatching. Such a disappointment. I'm still upset. It's been years. I know I need to move on lol. Luckily, HOTD has been pretty good, I like where the story is going but the time jumps kind of get to me. Hopefully that doesn't continue now that we've reached the beginning of the dance of the dragons.\nmyrandawolfe\nJan 18, 2023\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nLeft a bad taste that lingers for years\nMy rating for this series was a 10/10 until the final season. I avoid thinking about the show after I turned off the TV, put down the remote, left the room, and shut the door behind me. I don't even want to touch the DVD which is why they're still even on the shelf.\nWatching the final season was like watching a train speeding towards a broken bridge, and realizing too late that you are on the train.\nThe plot is forced (to end the show), the acting is forced (to follow the plot), and the characters are forced (to die).

Everything that you have heard about the show - from the wonderful visual effects, to the set design, the cinematography, the beautiful score to the acting - holds true till the very end. In that regard, this show (as of the writing of this review) is the benchmark and it'll be hard to get toppled over. The talented directors and writers over this 8 year period gave us a fantasy epic which has become a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon that will forever remain a huge part of many people's lives, and for that I am grateful.\nThe final season has just wrapped up, and unfortunately the show's legacy is now going to be two-fold. There was a time when people clamored to find out how Game of Thrones was going to conclude, a time where people were anxious because a show of this magnitude ending would leave a void in people's hearts that would be hard for any show to fill, a time where it seemed like this show was going to legitimize itself as *the* greatest show of all time. However, due to the nature of its conclusion, that is no longer the case. Game of Thrones is going to be remembered as quite possibly the greatest show with the greatest crashing of an ending.\nThe biggest issue of the series is going to come down to poor writing, poor pacing, and lack of episodes as it approached its final seasons. Season 7 and 8 represent mixed bags of goodies. You can tell what the goal of each big moment was and as a fan and I was all down for it. I'm not going to spoil what these moments were because i'd like new comers to not get deterred away from the massive onslaught by fans right now, but the thing to take away from this is that there's a significant dip in character arcs and there are choices that are made that just don't work because there was not enough time to execute them properly. I'm sure in the minds of the writers, they made sense because they have probably had in-depth discussions with each other about where each character is going to end up, but translating that to screen with fewer episodes where everything seems so overwhelmingly rushed skips the integral moments that help let the audience come along this journey. The pace at which the last two seasons have progressed contains frankly enough content to make at least 20 episodes, rather than just hastily putting it all in 13. We've received a conclusion that falls flat because it wasn't properly built up and earned. It's an ending which, while may represent the actual book ending, does not work for the direction the show was leading into.\nAll in all, I love Game of Thrones. It's still going to be up there regarded as one of the best series ever for good reason. It's just extremely disappointing and disheartening to witness the route it took towards the end which made it seem like the writers wanted to end the show as soon as possible (whether it be to work on other projects, or they simply did not really know how to expand it). It's going to leave the fanbase divided, but I hope over time people focus more on the good we got rather than the bad - because this show still deserves it.\nhassambitw\nMay 19, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nWas great, not anymore\nSeason 1-6 are some of the best season of TV I've watched, would give it a 10. Season 7 went way downhill as they tried to make too much happen too fast, would give it an 7.5. Season 8 sucks, would give it a 5. If I hadn't invested years in the show I'd stop watching\nbrianapeyton\nMay 10, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nGreat apart from S8\nI've really enjoyed GoT as a whole. Not everything has been perfect, but most shows are like that, and this is not your average TV-show.. This is an extremely rare genre - a dark fantasy show, i'm willing to cut them some slack. It's too bad about S8 though, i even liked the previous, rather fast paced season (which many people despised). Episode 4 of S8 really ruined a lot i think - it's overall sloppy and just plain dumb, very little effort and thought was put into it. You can tell the creators just got tired of it but continued due to it still making the $$$. We never asked for this.\ndawnrzr\nMay 5, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nSeason 8 is a disappointment\nDon't get me wrong this is still the best serie ever. But I agree with the rest season 8 is so rushed. The dialogues that make this serie so great are just rushed or are non existing in season 8.\nspolak-59278\nMay 14, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nIt was 10/10 till season 8\nThis series really blows your mind. Starts out hitting hard and always surprises you. You fall in love with some characters, and loathe others. The depth of the story is very well thought out and it seems like there is a large purpose for what you are watching. Season 7 was short but amazing. It told a story of something that we all dreaded was coming, an ending. But low and behold, season 8 rushes in and destroys all hope for a well written finale to a story that has dedicated to staying true to the plot. So if you just now start watching this show, prepare yourself for a disappointing end. And even after people saying that we never should have expected a happy ending, that wasn't what we hoped for. I believe we hoped for an ending that would coincide with the rest of the story. Not something rushed and out of the blue.\nrickfletcher28\nMay 20, 2019\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nA fascinating show with a terrible ending\nGame of Thrones is undoubtly the biggest TV show project to it's date. It has the quality of a blockbuster movie FX, CGI and acting-wise, and even a better scenario and story telling because it's based on a very well-written books series, A Song of Ice and Fire.\nBut everything changed after the show catched up to the book series it's based on, and producers started to write their own scenario. The quality of writing gradually declined after season 5 when this happened and hit rock bottom at the and of the show. The ending was terrificily dissapointing for most of the fans, and made literally no sense in my own opinion.\nIt could be a show worth of 9 or even 10. But last seasons made the show a cliche-hub and even ridicilous sometimes. I'm sorry for the wasted opportunity.\nemre_xxl\nMay 20, 2019\nPermalink\n25 more\nAll\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

It's hard to deny that it wasn't a cultural phenomenon that captivated me and many others for eight seasons.\nI've rated Game of Thrones a nine out of ten for its well-written and multi-layered storytelling, and its fantastic production value. However, despite still having amazing visuals and extremely high production value, like many fans, I was disappointed and to an extent frustrated by the final season's storytelling and how certain plot points were handled, which has lowered my rating from a ten to a nine. Despite this, Game of Thrones still remains for me a must-watch series and I would still highly recommend it to any fan of the fantasy or drama genre in general.\nDan_W_Reviews\nFeb 5, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nExtraordinary untill season 8\nThis is the first series i would recommend to anybody , it is an amazing piece of work , the most stunning TV series you will ever watch.\nWhy i gave it 9/10 because of the last season, it's still good but very disappointing compared to all the seasons. YOU will enjoy every episode\nalshamari-marwa\nMay 18, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\none the best shows ever made\nSeason 1-4 were practically perfect, there is not much to say. It had so many great moments, so many great episodes there. But then... well the writers kinda ran out of books to adapt. Season 5 and 6 were pretty boring most of the time. But they truly had their moments even having some of the best episodes of the show. Season 7 you could really see the dip in quality. Everything just felt so rushed most of it was really stupid. And then ofc. Season 8 the biggest disapointment I have ever seen. I have never seen anything more terrible. The ending was the stupidest thing i have ever seen. All of the characters were just so stupid. Everything felt even more rushed. And all the characters were basically ruined because of the writing. Overall i still give it a 9/10 just because of the first half of the show. And ofc it did still have its moments. I would still consider this show a masterpiece and I would 100% recomend. It is truly a must watch show.\ntobiascramon\nNov 8, 2022\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nCan we please just restart season 8, perhaps 7 as well, but mainly 8\nSpoiler\nadamheritage-15333\nMay 5, 2019\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nFinally, a Show that stays true to it's written roots\nAs an avid reader, I am often disappointed by what is represented by the silver screen. I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. \nSo when I saw the preview for \"Game of Thrones\" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. \nI was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. \nThe acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. \nIf you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. \nIf you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. \"Game of Thrones\" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.\nUPDATE:\nI have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. \nEach episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. \nA special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. \nEven after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.\nJschool03\nApr 17, 2011\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nThe beast\nOne of the best series I've ever seen, but the last season was ruined.\nhf-15699\nMay 1, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nA long time coming\nSo I succesfully avoided major spoilers about the show and could binge watch this since the complete Box set came out in early December. The first season was a bit overwhelming, what with all the houses and characters thrown at you. As you may be able to tell, I have not read the source material. Not sure who of the cast had read it beforehand either. So bare that in mind.\nNow the line Winter is coming is something everyone associates with the show, I just never expected this to come up so early in the show. What is surprising, at least during the first seasons of the show, is how many supposedly main characters fail to survive. This keeps the viewers on their tows. Towards the end of the show this gets a bit watered down. Not sure how much influence the original author had there (he had only written material for the first 6 seasons of the show, the rest was made up).\nHaving said that, you can feel a drop in quality. And while I have friend who thought the second season was boring (it's a bit of a travelling show and things get stretched quite a bit), if he continued to watch, he might feel even worse with the last seasons. Even though they are shorter (episode wise, not time wise per episode), they feel stretched even more.\nAlso the conclusion (no worries, I'm not telling) is anticlimatic to say the least. It feels bad and the continuity errors are just thrown aside. So if not for the epic battles and the actors, who are all really amazing in this, I might have gone farther down with my vote. Then again, if it wasn't for the last season specifically, I might have given it a 10 too ... A prequel show has been axed for now (not sure if the bad reviews and or numbers for the last season played a role), but I would watch it. This achieved overall something that \"The Reign\" could not: combine violence, fantasy and nudity into something mature/adult that works for men and women watching\nkosmasp\nJan 1, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nProbably the Best TV Show ever to be destroyed!\nI started watching this show merely because people around me asked me to. By the end of Season 1 it really had me invested my time and curiosity. Later seasons got me completely hooked and made me a kind of free marketing agent for this show since I was telling my friends to watch this show.\nI believe the graph of the show starts at the lowest point and from ending season 1 gets a drastic rise. In my opinion it peaks at Season 4 and slowly declines from there. From Season 7 it drops completely and utterly.\nThe last season had my huffing and puffing at every turning point, I would like to appreciate the cinematography of Season 8 which is by far the best in the whole show. The music I would say was best in season 6 and 7.\nIt remains my favorite show till date, and yet the perfect example of 'Messing up something absolutely beautiful'.\nAverage_Critic\nJan 17, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nThe egomaniac(s) that made Bad season 8/ finale decisions\nSpoiler\nmarianela-02278\nApr 24, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nVintage television\nAn all time classic tv show - with a rather weak ending (hence the star deduction).

Season 7 was not great but also not terrible. Season 8 was quit terrible and probably ruined the long term reputation for the series unfortunately.\ndaniel_fischermann\nApr 14, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nHistorical\nThis series - hard to believe it's over a decade old! It's one of the greatest of all times. Without giving much away, the latter season felt a bit rushed, but certainly there are no loose ends in this unforgettable medieval fantasy series. The warring factions are captivating and all have their own vibe. The original and screenplay writers do a great job of bringing the vibrant universe to life. The acting and direction are top notch. The film score is absolutely cinematic and helps set the scene. The set design and costumes are perfect and all seem real. If you've been living under a rock, it's time to watch this show!\ngillmurphydogg\nFeb 7, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nGreat show\nIt was a great viewing experience if you exclude the last season.\naloneboyhriday\nApr 30, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nOne Of The Best Forms Of Media I Have Seen\nSeason 1-6= 10/10\nSeason 7= 8/10\nSeason 8= 6/10\nSeason 1-6 of Game Of Thrones is masterful, some of the best Television, or story I have seen. Character deaths, shocking, engaging, fantastic dialogue, incredible twists, intense, awesome battles, violent, incredible story and nuanced and complex characters with incredible world building and characters that you just fall in love with, with incredible arcs (Jaime, Cersei, Jon, Tyrion, Danerys, Robb, Ned etc)\nThere is no other TV Show Like Game Of Thrones 1st 6 seasons, no other tv shows gives you the same feeling as episodes such as- Baelor, The Rains Of Castamere, Blackwater, Battle Of The Bastards, Laws Of Gods And Men, The Winds Of Winter, Hardhome, Mother's Mercy etc.\nGame Of Thrones S1-6 are easily a 10/10.\nSeason 7 isn't as good as those 6 seasons, its still great television with awesome episodes such as The Spoils Of War and 'The Dragon And The Wolf' and Jaimie and Cersei Lannister are the best they've been (my personal favourite 2 characters). But the pacing feels a bit off, ep 5 and 6 feel rushed, disjointed and more generic. It's a set up season for S8 and while its still a great season of TV, you can see where it started to go a bit downhill. Still a solid entry in the GOT Saga.\nSeason 8 is hugely disappointing, Great battles, music, production and acting.\nthe story, characters, pacing and writing are not good. It's too crammed with too many stories and characters to fit in only 6 episodes and The ending of The Long Night negates the entire theme of Game Of Thrones, leaving for a disappointing 2nd half. Also, what they did with Jaimie Lanister and The Night King is unforgivable, GOT always shocked fans with great twists, but in S8 it's shocking at the expense of telling a good story.\nEven tho S8 is disappointing, GOT is still absolutely worth the watch, its one of a kind TV Show and the first 7 seasons are 100% worth watching.\ndymogauk\nApr 10, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nGame of power is a medieval epic fantasy drama in the United States.\nThe plot structure is complete, the details are rich, and the creativity is infinite. On the premise of maintaining the flavor of the original, the TV play is more concise and the key points are more prominent. The characters of the play are bright and wonderful. The whole play is not only magnificent in scenes and exquisite in production, but also exquisite in photography, clothing, setting and art. The plot integrates a variety of elements and is dressed in magic. However, it reflects the real world in the illusion, and focuses on the struggle of political power.\nxuefeiding\nApr 24, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nMy rating on Game of thrones, from start to finish.\nGame of Thrones\nWhere should one start? I can basically say that the series is well done. Great acting and casting.\nHowever, I must say that it can seem a bit long-winded. But if you keep watching the series, you will feel joy, and pain, and frustration.\n1 good thing about Game of Thrones is that the series goes almost like the real world, except for Dragons, which makes you mysteriously love dragons like that after a while.\nI'm a big fan of the characters, the way all the younger actors and older actors grow with age.\nI am especially a fan of the execution of effects and the music that is played together.\nI definitely also thought that the history and execution of the forged weapons, such as swords, daggers and axes/hammers, plus also has a great effect on the story and the character.\nThe series is a must see, if you are a fan of fantasy and magical creatures.\nSyanaes\nOct 5, 2022\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nThis was so close to being the best thing ever made\nSpoiler\ntoby_maughan\nAug 16, 2021\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nNothing much to add\nLike everyone did I was stunned by how this show was so good in terms of the turn of events and unexpectable moments and deaths\nso many layered characters , acting was on point\nBUT ... also like everyone did I was SOCKED by S8 it was not the best ending season for this amazing show but not so terrible at least we got an ending I guess lol\nanyways I highly recommend this show to everyone\nhaithembadidou-25025\nMay 26, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nDisappointing final season\nSpoiler\nfwilbrink\nMay 6, 2019\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nDo not watch The last season\n1-6 seasons were 10/10. 7th season was meh ok. 8 season was garbage.\nHighly recommend 1-6 seasons.

And yes of course that's because of the bad making of the season finale, I can totally understand that. After all these years hardwork, creating and developing each and every character from bottom to top, memories, emotions throughout the process all went to vain for one bad making. It's so painful to accept it for the audience who invested lots of time watching the show from the starting and then finishing it like this! It's a long long journey. I don't even remember the day I started watching it and since then I waited the next year to come for the new season. I can't say anything more. Only one last request, could you please delete the whole season 8 and make a new version of it? Please?\nSaifOVGU\nApr 8, 2020\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nOne of the best shows ever\nYou know a lot people say this about a ton of different shows but Game of Thrones is absolutely, without a doubt, one of the best TV shows ever created...it's damn near perfect (except for maybe the last few episodes of the last season) and easily one of my all-time favorite shows! Yeah, the last few episodes of Season 8 weren't that good and the ending was just awful but the first 7 1/2 seasons were so amazing that it still gets a 10 from me! It's one of the rare shows where I can watch it all the way from the first episode to the last and never get bored. I'm pretty sure there's never been a show more talked about or more loved in the history of television than GOT. All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is! It's absolutely amazing.\nSupermanfan-13\nDec 9, 2023\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nDespite the final season, Game of Thrones remains an all time classic\nAs we prepare for the House of the Dragon, we look back on the brilliance that once was Game of Thrones. Seasons 1-6 are truly outstanding television, right up there with The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Wire, best of the best. Season 7 was a drop in quality but still somewhat enjoyable, and then came Season 8 which was a blunder of epic proportions. A Rushed, botched, lazy ending and a slap in the face to both new and old fans alike.\nThat being said, nothing can take away from the wild, brilliant, emotional ride that is Game of Thrones seasons 1-6, a television show that defined a decade and changed pop culture forever. I like to believe that it was cancelled after Season 6 and we never get to see the true ending ;)\nheavenacceptme\nAug 22, 2022\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nThis is a television show?\nWas over-time on a gradual binge of watching 'Game of Thrones' from the first episode (gradual because of being so busy), having heard nothing but amazing things about it from friends, family and IMDb reviewers. Plus with such a great cast of talent and a brilliant book series, how could it possibly go wrong? \nThe good news is that 'Game of Thrones' didn't go wrong. Quite the opposite. Not only is it a rare television show that does its original source material justice and treats it with respect but it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years. A television show so brilliant that one has to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. This is one of the strongest examples of an acclaimed show that deserves every ounce of the praise it's garnered.\nVisually, 'Game of Thrones' looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. Then there are the special effects that are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.\nOne cannot talk about 'Game of Thrones' without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.\nIt is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story-lines are paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and touch upon complex and sensitive themes with intelligence and tact.\nWhenever there's a set-piece or more action-oriented scene there's always a reason, never there for the sake of it. Not only are the set-pieces done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one. They're not overlong, nor are there out of place elements.\nCharacters are a huge part of the appeal too. 'Game of Thrones' has characters that are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (Joffrey is the only one close to that, the difference though is that he is an extremely interesting one with a lot of development who ranks well beyond one hundred percent on the threat level scale), they have much more to them and have strengths and flaws. Decisions are logical and one doesn't like any character any less when a decision is not the right one because mistakes are acknowledged and learnt from.\n'Game of Thrones' cast is full of talented names and, thanks to so well rounded characters and such great writing, nothing but the very best is gotten out of them. Even those who are not favourites of mine. Big acting standouts are Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson (Joffrey being the king of all young characters with not a redeeming bone in their body).\nIn conclusion, absolutely outstanding and a rare television show worthy of being a cinematic modern classic. This review may sound superlatively hyperbolic, but to me 'Game of Thrones' is that good. 10/10 Bethany Cox\nTheLittleSongbird\nNov 8, 2017\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nAmazing\nWhat can be said about Game of Thrones that hasn't already been said? It's universally thought of as one of the best series in the history of television. Look up any \"best shows ever\" list and I promise you'll find Game of Thrones near the top of every list you'll find. Obviously everyone knows the last episode was absolutely awful, even most of the actors have come out and said they didn't like it. Having said that, it doesn't take away from the show being amazing. One bad show doesn't take away from the other 72 episodes that were almost perfect! I've watched the entire series all the way through twice now and if anything I just appreciate this show even more.\nRob1331\nNov 10, 2023\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nU don't watch GOT..U Live GOT......\nLegendary....

I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.\nHaving said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.\nThere is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.\nIt is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.\nYes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.\nThe scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.\nAfter watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like \"Merlin\" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.\nEven if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this.\npaulday98\nApr 18, 2011\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nOne of the best series ever made\nFor me it's one of the best series ever made and yes I know about the polemic last season but to be honest the last season had amazing episodes with amazing scenes, obviously that it was a rushed final but that was only HBO fault, about the ending I think it was a good and expectable ending , keep in mind that the last books haven't came out yet so the producers didn't have books to follow like in the previous seasons and they consulted the creator about the end and followed the lines that he gave to them, the final is like the own creator said it would be... bittersweet!\nBut let's not allow that to ruin this iconic series that will always be a classic. You know how great this was when the big question is: \"Which serie will become the next Game of Thrones?\". This is just legendary!\njcarlos-96740\nMar 7, 2020\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nA Need Fulfilled\nI am writing this because according to the IMDB User Ratings, I have not commented. I have reviewed all the individual episodes, but not the show as a whole. There is little that I can add to the impact of this show. I am proud to be on the same planet as those who created and put this work into fruition. When one looks at the technical accomplishments and the multiple plot strains that have been kept in balance, it is truly a wonder. I know that there are those who can never get past the \"book did this\" and \"the book did that.\" We have to come to realize that it is impossible to recreate every nuance that fiction allows and that occasionally characters must be dropped and events assumed. For me, I have approached these as the artistic creations they are--as film (and television, at that). I have the books. I've not read them but plan to at some point. I doubt at this late stage of my life there will ever be another series to match this. I like fantasy but am not ruled by it as a genre. But this is for us all. If you've not seen it, treat yourself.\nHitchcoc\nJan 5, 2018\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nLord of the Rings - I think not!\nSeeing a review comparing this brilliant title to Lord of the Rings made me make an account here and post my very first review. \nI had very high expectations from this series and I believed that it will (like most TV series) absolutely ruin the book. And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start...\nThe cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. Now to get to the part most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series?\nTHIS IS NOT LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that I got that out, I can continue. The very idea behind the series is a lot different. It's based around great families on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. And there are many secrets, You will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. If you cannot follow the story just yet, don't worry! It's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will BEG for next episode just to see what happens.\nWhat to expect? Plots, love, action, war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... All that after the first episode. I really hope they will not ruin it as the series progress. \nConclusion: Do not miss this! Yes YOU complaining that the book is better. And everyone else.\nunknownmirc\nApr 17, 2011\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nGOT ruined TV for me!\nEver since I've watched the last available season of GOT I haven't been able to get into any other show. I've tried countless new shows and nothing even comes close to GOT! The way the multiple story lines and characters Intertwine with one another is absolutely genius! The idea that someone created this entire world from their imagination is unbelievable. The acting is suburb and you can't help but to fall in love or despise the characters. The cinematography and CGI is stunning. You'll be completely immersed in Westeros! Wishing you could just jump in and be a part of the story! So many twist and turns and things you'd never expect.

The highly talented show-runners David Benioff and Dan Weiss took the unadaptable giant books by George R. R. Martin and transformed them into this beautifully constructed show, that something of it's kind was never done before. There are so many layers to this story, so many characters and story arcs intertwining with each other that it seems impossible to grasp one man came up with it all.\nThe story Martin created is probably one of the better and most detailed and well-crafted stories of all times, and David and Dan's transformation of the story to the TV medium was beautifully handled. There aren't that many shows when you sit and watch an episode and savor every single scene, if it's the content itself or the many small details that were precisely designed for every frame you watch. It takes a little time to get into the show in the beginning, just because it's very different from what we are generally used to. It's one of those shows that from the very first episode until the last it's just one big story so you just need patience to get used to everything that's going on in there, and after that enjoyment is guaranteed. Above all, the thing the show benefited perhaps the most of is the fact that ever since the day they started writing the first script- the complete story from start to finish was compiled in George's head. Not all the details and specifics of course, but the outline and major plot points were invented years ago when he started working on this huge book series, therefore the production knew exactly where to start, where the story is heading and where it ends, which gave consistency to the story from episode 1 to 73, without getting lost in the way with loose threads.\nThe show gets plenty of criticism for its deviations from the source material season 5 and onwards, but if you just think for a second how enormous this story is it's pretty easy to realize a lot needed to be altered to fit the TV medium, and David and Dan managed to do so while preserving the original essence of Martin's creation, keep the story well constructed and coherent and keep dozens of millions of viewers satisfied, and not only a handful of hard core followers that wanted it to be a page- to-page adaption of the novels. While I enjoyed all the books and didn't agree with a few of the changes they made for the show as well I can see why a lot had to be cut, things don't work the same in books as in television. Considering they knew the ending from the start and the huge amount of details you have to alter just from omitting one storyline if you want to reach the same final goal as the books, I believe it was overall for the best and they knew what they were doing, the story didn't collapse under their hands- at least as far as I'm concerned.\nHBO really brought their A-Team of directors to handle this show, as you'll find not a few episodes here that would rival works of highly acclaimed cinematic directors with 10 times the budget, whether it's a giant action episode or a well-made drama piece. The production values of the show, like many other things- again, unrivaled by anything else. If it's the locations, effects, production design, costumes, you name it- it's not for nothing it's the most Emmy Awarded show of all times by such a large margin. The fact the show takes place in a fantasy-medieval world gives it an edge in that matter, but the impeccable level of detail the behind-the-curtains crew puts in every frame makes it head and shoulders above everything else on TV, if not also big-budget Hollywood productions. One of the most prominent aspects of this show in my opinion is Ramin Djawadi's masterful score which must be one of the most brilliantly unique works ever for a series (whether it's a series of movies or TV series) not only because of the compositions themselves, which are exceptionally beautiful, but also for how the music evolves throughout the seasons and builds the world of the show hand to hand with the writing, the characters and the setting as the story progresses. Also, the way each motif of the music identifies with a certain aspect of the story, though mostly noticeable in later seasons, tells a complete story on its own. Never seen anything like it.\nThe fact that the show is consisting of so many different characters in different locations, with different story arcs that all, eventually, intertwine with each other only adds to the re-watchability value of the show as a whole. You have so many different types of plots, sometimes in different overall genres and such a large variety of types of characters that it's hard to get bored like you get sometimes if you watch the same linear story over and over again. The show became famous for the habit of pulling the rug underneath our feet and even if you know what's coming when you watch the show again, sometimes it's even more fun to anticipate these huge turning points and to pay attention to everything that leads there.\nSay what you will about the final seasons, it's amazing the show started to really divide the fan base only in its very last season, that being it's eighth one- something that is ultimately unavoidable with something in that magnitude of popularity, that has so many characters and storylines for people to nit-pick from. We've seen it with the Sopranos. We've seen it with Seinfeld. We've seen it countless other times- if your show is popular enough and you give the audience an ending which is anything but most conventional conclusion possible- or, god forbid, an ending which is little bit brave- you are going to get the heat. We probably must address the elephant in the room, which is the controversy around the final season, even though I truly believe it'll all be gone in the wind in a few months. As I said it's expected some will be disappointed with the way elements of the story have concluded but I believe people went way overboard and overreacted with their negativity and scrutiny towards these final episodes, something that originated heavily from being swept by the negative buzz on social media. A lot of plot points that were deemed by a lot of people as \"making no sense\" from the characters perspective are, at least in my opinion, totally in line with their arcs on the show if you give a moments thought about it. After you come to the season with that approach it's pretty fun to enjoy it, having the most ambitious battle ever filmed for television directed by the amazing Miguel Sapochnik, few heartbreaking moments, the destructive and highly impressive fifth episode and most of all beautiful conclusions to arcs we've been following for the past 8 years. In a show this popular, when it came to writing the ending to all these story arcs it seems nowadays a writer has two choices- giving the internet audience what they always wanted and predicted or just going with your vision and making a brave ending actually staying true to the show and it's characters- which is exactly what David and Dan did. Though if you choose the latter option, be sure you are ready to take all the heat- and GoT is not merely the first example of that on television in the last couple of decades. I don't think there was anything as pop-culture as GoT in it's early seasons, and with the social media and internet meme-culture so present these days- this time this phenomenon was taken to heights never seen before.\nAfter re-watching the show for the first time after knowing how it concludes, the ending makes even more sense. All the arcs are building up beautifully towards the endgame, and it make you understand better some of the choices they made along the way, knowing where it all intended to go. It also makes you understand some of the characters better, and re-contextualizing a lot of things you thought while watching the show the first times around.\nAll these wordy descriptions couldn't however describe the experience of watching this show live as it aired. The thrill, the off-season anticipation and continuous speculations, the satisfaction of watching a new amazing episode after waiting for so long, the 8-years-long water-cooler talks and the overall influence GoT had on pop culture in the time it was on TV- I'm sure many of us will always remember how it felt, and I'm not sure if we'll get to experience something like that anytime soon. I already watched each season several times, probably more than any other show or movie, and I never get tired of any of it, if it's the well constructed dialogues or blood pumping action sequences. I definitely see myself still constantly revisiting seasons every once in a while from now until further notice.\nI think the success of the show speaks for itself- the countless awards, high acclaim from casual viewers and critics alike, the major fan following, it's influences on the television landscape and on culture in general- it's a winner in all fronts. Even 4 years later everyone is still talking about it, and the prequel series broke records because of the high anticipation from the audience. Seems like GoT is on its way to become the next big franchise. In my personal opinion it's the greatest television series ever made, but generally speaking I think it's safe to say this show is for the ages and I think it will be remembered for a long time as one of the greatest cinematic works ever produced. I just hope the uproar on social media will calm down eventually so we can once again all enjoy this show together. People tend to use this word too cheaply these days, but I wouldn't say Game of Thrones is anything short of a masterpiece.\nDvir971\nAug 8, 2019\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nIt's so hard to rate even 9 to this show, because it's so unique & revolutionary.

So I pretty much knew of the characters and storylines as I watched the whole series. This meant no (major) surprises, and limited emotional impact re how good/bad the series became over the years. In my view, the whole series rates as a 10/10. Some episodes better/worse than others, of course. But as an engaging and gripping series it blew me away.\n*High points*\nThe Purple Wedding (Joff is SO evil, got his just desserts indeed). Tyrion's trial - I absolutely loved Peter Dinklage throughout, but he was awesome here, at his peak performance. I was prepared not to like the various battle episodes (normally multitask during that type of scene), but these were also awesome - particularly Hardhome, Battle of the Bastards, Spoils of War.\nFor individual characters - Ned's demise, Jaime/Brienne (all their scenes), Arya/The Hound scenes, also her later scenes with Gendry. The look of unrequited love in Jorah's eyes. Hodor & the door. Bronn's avarice (although beginning to pall in S8). Littlefinger's dawning realisation that he'd been rumbled by the Stark ladies. The genuine warmth of the Nights Watch relationships with each other. So many other great performances, even if not main cast.\n*Low points*\nOK - agree with the haters that the Long Night battle was a strategy fiasco. Was never that keen on Bran & the 3-eyed raven stuff. Dorne storylines seemed superfluous after Oberyn's death (which was awesome!). Euron - ridiculously OTT character. The increasingly unbelievable time-shifts allowing characters to travel across Westeros in unfeasible times.\nI've never binge-watched anything before and was completely obsessed with GOT. Spent half the last season in tears. Watched so many episodes through my fingers, such was the gore/shock factor. Hard to see what is going to replace it for my evening binge-viewing from now. Kudos to all the cast and crew for a completely amazing show.\nJockette\nJan 12, 2020\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nThis TV series is magnificent!\nThis TV series is magnificent! I read a book and I must say that A Game Of Thrones is one of the best books I've read. So when I first heard that HBO will do a series on the this book I was thrilled but I was afraid that they will not be done exactly by the book. But I must say that I was wrong and that the series is better than I thought it would be. Much better! \nWhile I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book. HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series. \nFor me the biggest surprise of the series I figure Daenerys Targaryen. Emilia Clarke actress who plays Daenerys Targaryen is more beautiful than I imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book. \nThe Wall is a lot different than I had imagined, but in a good way. \nThe series revolves around Eddard Stark and his family. He has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. Eddard Stark is ruler of the North and close friend of King Robert who needs his help in ruling the Seven Kingdoms.\nThe seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. Across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. To the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures of myth and legend that have been forgotten.\nsalerkbozava\nApr 18, 2011\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nFresh and Exciting\nGame of Thrones on HBO is a TV adaption of George R.R. Martin's books, a Song of Ice and Fire. For those fans who know and love the books, then you can't help but love the TV adaptation. It is difficult to translate books into movies or TV series, but HBO's GoT made it look easy. The characters, cast, scenery, costume, etc., all looked incredible, and gave me the feeling that I was inside the books themselves. Although not every little detail was translated perfectly, and nor should they be, the pilot episode was a grand achievement.\nFor all those Nay-Sayers out there: If you don't like the series, then you probably have never read the books or watched the countless behind the scenes trailers that helped those who didn't understand the complex storyline. Yes, this story is complex, its original, its fresh, and it is very exciting. The story line gets better with each episode. You also have to keep in mind that this story is an adult story, and as I said, it is complex. Simply put, HBO didn't dumb the story down, but rather remained true to the core of this epic fantasy. For those who have never read the books and found the pilot interesting, trust me it gets better and better. Stick with it.\nrenbeaudoin\nApr 18, 2011\nPermalink\n25 more\nAll\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

Everyone goes on and on and on about how great it is; and my expectations for this show was equally high. However, I was really, really let down. Really. This wasn't the best show ever, as I had thought it would be. Don't get me wrong, the show is enjoyable, but it's definitely not among the best shows out there. I hope Shippuden will better than this... much better.\n\nThe concept of this show isn't that hard to follow. It's an alternate world in which ninjas live. The ninjas fight by using various skills, and\n\n...\n\nthey have this power flowing inside of them called chakra. Chakra is used to perform powerful attacks which (usually) belongs to either of the five traditional elements of earth, fire, water, air and lightning. Of course, since they are ninjas, they fight with weapons like shuriken and kunai as well as hand-to-hand combat. As expected of this kind of world, there's evil people, having different goals and reasons behind their evil.\n\nThe story follows Naruto, one of these ninjas, as he grow as a ninja, from being a stupid little prank-playing brat to becoming a fine ninja. Along the way, he interacts with and makes friends with many fellow ninja, fighting his way towards his dream of becoming Hokage (the leader of his village). \n\nThe story isn't nearly as good as the concept would indicate. Sure, a lot of the characters has some nice background stories, won't complain about that, but they manage to drag out everything so much. It really annoys me. Some fights take several episodes when they could've been done them just as good in one or two. There's also way too much fighting. The story goes like fight, fight, background story, fight, fight, even more fight, half an episode's worth of resting or journeying, fight, fight, and so on. I mean, it's cool to watch fights, but there are just way too many fights, and they drag most of them out to unnecessary lengths. The only really enjoyable fight was the one between Sasuke and Naruto right before the fillers began. Which brings up another thing...\n\nFillers! Agh, I normally don't mind fillers, but Naruto had some really, really stupid ones. Sure, there was the occasional diamond among the charcoal, but that doesn't excuse the high amount of bad fillers. I mean, just because they are fillers doesn't mean that they have to make them bad. Several shows have actually made decent and at the same time long fillers (especially Bleach, with its 40-episode long Bount arc), but Naruto failed horribly here. \n\nAlso, I feel that Naruto is very silly at times. Silly is usually good, but not when it's immature silly. And guess what+ Naruto is silly in an immature way. It's so dreadfully stupid at times that I had to close my eyes, take a deep breath and wait until it got serious again. Now, it did have some good comical moments, but those were far and wide between.\n\nAnother thing I feel like releasing my rage on is the animation. It barely manages to get the description &ldquo;average&rdquo; to me. At its best, it's slightly above average. However, a lot of time it's slipshod galore with the animation. I still have many very bad memories from having to watch lots of errors in the animation, and I'm not sure if I'll ever get rid of those memories. While the amount of errors decreased as the episodes passed by, at least every second episode before the 100s had one or more moments of slipshod animation. Wonder if they ever considered firing the animators.\n\nAs a side mention, they should do something about Rock Lee - even though I've slightly gotten used to his horrible looks, I still feel a burn in the back of my eye every time I see him.\n\nThe music is pretty good, though. A lot of great tunes (especially the sad ones are great), and the first few OPs and EDs were pretty awesome. It has some really bad music parts too, like the tribal voice-ish song, and sometimes they could've used better themes during the fights. As the series progressed, the quality of the OPs and EDs decrease too.\n\nThe characters are fairly okay, I guess. Some of them are really annoying, like Naruto, because he's so stupid. Agh, he annoys me to no end! Some other characters are annoying too, because of things like their looks (Gai and Lee), or because they are failed attempts at comical relief (at least in my eyes, you might find them funny), like the all too perverted Jiraiya.\n\nThat's the negative about them. However, they have some really nice background stories, some which are elaborated more upon than others. Many of the characters also get fair amounts of screen time, which for some people can seem too much, whilst others will be content with it, because their favorite character from the show gets an episode for him/herself. \n\nI also like the fact that most of them have dreams or aspirations, and motives for what they are doing and how they are acting (usually it's tied together with their background stories). The growing relationships between them is also nice, their maturing, and how Naruto is slowly getting accepted by more and more people through hard work. \n\nBasically, they've portrayed the characters very well, and not too over the top, but some of them act stupid and silly from time to time, which drags the character rating down.\n\nI have some mixed feelings for the show, which kind of drags down on the enjoyability factor of it. Great concept, not as good story, both good and bad music, horrid animation at times, many characters with background stories, some of them great and some not-so-great; it's hard to completely make up my mind, but I believe the ratings I have given shows my feelings towards the different aspects of the show.\n\nOf course, even though there was things I didn't like, I can easily see why this show is so popular as it is; it has humor that the kids may find funny, as well as lots of fights which appeal to the teenagers and adults. I personally didn't like it that much, though. I'm looking forward to Shippuden, because I&rsquo;ve heard it was much better&hellip; I really hope so!\n\nTo 'Not Helpful' voters (and you 'Helpful' voters too): Feedback greatly appreciated =)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheLlama (\n65\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 25, 2008\n\ntheeggman85\n\nRecommended\n\n I began to browse through the reviews of Naruto, and realized something was horribly wrong. All the experienced anime watchers were giving it crappy reviews, and all the first-timers were giving it rave reviews, with reasons that every anime has to back them up. How could this be? Gee, I wonder. For some strange reason, Naruto has become the most popular and well-known anime series ever, and as such, it is usually the first anime seen by anime watchers alike. Why this is, I don't know. Maybe it appeals to a wide variety of young teenagers...\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I remember watching and\n\n...\n\nloving this anime. I had never seen any other anime shows, and I thought the concept was original and amazing. When I found out that others animes literally had all that Naruto had plus a lot more, I was... bored with all the fillers. At the time the anime was great, but it really does get old.\n\nThen again, the anime is not absolutely horrible. It has the essentials, with a somewhat unique story and art style. The characters are cliche, and enjoyment is there but short and sweet.\n\nWhat I truly love about Naruto is the great soundtrack. It seems that all the OP and ED are just fabulous, and the music just fits within the series. I would have liked a bit of a change over the course of the show, but hey, it almost never happens.\n\nAll in all, it was a good show. Just good. So basically: Shame on those people who watch 10 episodes and immediately come here and write a review. Also shame on people who give this show all 1's because everyone else loves it. It's OK, but ive definitely seen better.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by theeggman85 (\n21\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 3, 2011\n\nArtimesGamer\n\nRecommended\n\n Naruto, yes Naruto. One of the series that has defined the cultural shonen’s of the last generation in the history of anime. This is a series that has changed significantly over the past decade.\n\nWhat I love bout naruto is the whole “Ninja aspect” of the show. Every technique had substance, quality and all of the training arcs really shown the defining elements of how ninjutsu worked within the naruto universe. These qualities are something I will soon not forget. I know alot of people complain about naruto being a half ass wit that can’t do nothing Or perhaps sakura being useless. But in away\n\n...\n\nI look at the series as being a little different, especially in the developing of characters.\n\nKishimoto did not intend to create the story with a “bad ass” character right from the start, toppling villains one after the other, no. Naruto was set up in a way that much resembles an ordinary life and the tribulations and tests you must go through. Death is at every corner and naruto is a kid that is trying to fit in with the rest of the shinobi and be \"recognized\" I think that was one of the main defining elements of the original series. Kishi wanted to show here is a character that no one likes because he has a living breathing monster inside of him. You can only wonder what he is thinking, being in his predicament.\n\nWatching him grow up as a monster and trying to be known as a famous shinobi and protect his friends, but realizing that he is in a world fraught with danger at every corner. Watching his friends die before him or getting hurt. The degree of emotion in the series was something I really enjoyed. It was really powerful. I remember hearing people spout nonsense in the discussions boards \"omg to much drama, get on with the fighting already\" But I actually liked how naruto had that drama, it fit in with the entire theme of the series. It kind of brings a whole different realism to the show compared to other shonen series. I won’t state any names.\n\nOne of the things that kishi really focused on in the original was friendship, and bonds. Thats one of the major theme's watching this team 7 grow up together, learning from kakashi and becoming great ninja in the process, learning the ways of the ninja world. This show explores themes of revenge, hate, bonds and sorrow to a very astounding degree.\n\n The characters in this series were in every sense of the word children, growing up in a world full of adults that were much more talented ninja's both skills and combat. That is not to say the show was made for children. Just that kishi wanted to show the younger generation as the main characters of the show and the older generation as the training shinobi. They had to learn the ropes of what being a ninja is like. After their pre training sessions, they were finally put to the test of just how grueling the world is and how they must use every ounce of there being to survive and also protect the people they love.\n\n10 years ago people viewed naruto very different to how people view it today.\n\nI still consider naruto to be one of my favorite quality anime series, regardless of where it’s going. Perhaps maybe its because im very infatuated with ninja's and like the unique way that kishi has created this ninja world. Similar to how i really love pirates in the one piece world. Every arc is something new and fresh so kishi can develop on that and expand upon the show in various different ways. One piece had some of the greatest character back stories and cast I’ve seen in a series, but it did suffer from story progression a bit thankfully naruto does not. It has a pretty solid pace and some of the most ground breaking plot twists.\n\nI guess it’s all a matter of personal preference and what you like to see in a show. I my self im not a huge fan of typical shonene tropes that are used consistently, but i love how the original series gave us a much more powerful emotional impact to the show. In away it felt more humanized as apposed to the more generic super power elements of shipuuden.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ArtimesGamer (\n27\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 30, 2011\n\nSton3_FreeN7\n\nRecommended\n\n I'm sure most, if not all, the people who end up reading this review have seen Naruto before and those who haven't are probably put off by the pure unadulterated hatred this and the more recent Shippuuden garner. Okay, I guess \"unadulterated\" is a strong word but I digress..\n\nIn any case, before starting this review I want to point out that I haven't read the manga so I'm unsure as to what was or wasn't changed during the process of animating this story and I guess it's time to get the show on the road. \n\n*Also, let it be known that the infamous \"Filler Arc\"\n\n...\n\nis not part of this review.\n\nNaruto is the story of a group of rookie ninja from Konoha (Leaf) Village, with particular focus on our title character Naruto Uzumaki and his two friends Sakura Haruno and Sasuke Uchiha. The story starts soon after the three of them graduate from there Ninja Academy and are put under the care of Kakashi Hatake who, for the most part, takes on the standard role of the \"mentor\" who teaches them the value of teamwork and all that jazz.\n\nThe main characters can apparently be hit or miss, though I liked them for the most part. Naruto himself seems to follow in the footsteps of Goku from the Dragon Ball franchise, though I personally don't consider him anywhere near as dense and also don't consider him an \"idiot\" like most people tend to.\n\nSakura seems to get the most flack from my experience because, for the most part she plays the \"useless female\" role. The thing is, she herself realizes that and actively tries to change herself which makes for some interesting scenes down the road. \n\nSasuke is probably the most intriguing of the main characters, simply because he himself admits that he is only training to \"kill a certain man\" and he and Naruto clash quite a few times over their belief systems, particularly in the oh so excellent final arc.\n\nAs far as Kakashi, there isn't a whole lot to say as he reveals very few nuggets of information about himself. He's a cool guy, but he's very much a supporting character during this series.\n\nBut, to be honest, the thing that Naruto can be proud of is the excellent cast of supporting characters. From the intelligent, yet lethargic Shikamaru to the Bruce Lee wanna be Rock Lee it's pretty cool to see all these different characters, who usually have a very interesting and unique fighting style, clash with one another. \n\nIt also should be mentioned that a certain villain, Orochimaru, who appears rather frequently is a scene stealer and takes part in some of the more memorable moments of this series. It's also when he appears that the show really takes off and gets interesting, as he is the instigator of some of the biggest plot points. His personality and his willingness to use any and all means to further himself and his power is interesting and very often disturbing.\n\nOne thing that is important throughout the series is the running theme of revenge and human relations. Every one, from Gaara to Sasuke to Naruto himself has had some sort of bad experience during their childhood and it seems as though \"friendship overcoming tragedy\" is maybe the predominate theme throughout the show. \n\nNow this series being a shounen, it's obvious it has pacing flaws here and there. For example, many of the fight scenes are dragged out to an annoying degree. And this is very apparent in the first arc when the characters go through two separate fight scenes that both take at the very least three or four episodes each, which isn't a huge problem if you marathon the series like I did. But, it still deserves mentioning as it is annoying.\n\nThe plus side is that most fight scenes, particularly during the Chuunin Exam arc and beyond, are very well animated and just overall well done. The aforementioned Shikamaru for example has some of the more noteworthy scenes because he uses his head, instead of any physical abilities, and his fight scenes are always damn good fun.\n\nBut, this also highlights one of the issues I do have with the fight scenes and, even though this is a problem with shounen action anime in general, it's especially bothersome here. The characters have a habit of explaining everything they do to their enemy which would be time better spent actually defeating your opponent rather than telling them your skills. I know it's just so the mangaka can flex his thought process and the logic behind the attacks to the viewer but..it's still kind of tiresome and could certainly be implemented better.\n\nI think the music bears mentioning as I thought it was either great, such as most of the music used during the dramatic scenes and some battle scenes, or forgettable, which is pretty much the rest of the fight scene music. \n\nThe Japanese voice actors did a great job imo, especially during some of the more serious scenes. But, I especially got to shout out to the multiple voices for Orochimaru. Of which almost all of them are suitably creepy and, even though they sound different, they still manage to pull off the basic speech patterns. \n\nIn Summary:\n\nStory: 7\n\nIt takes a while for things to really get going, but once it does you'll notice it. Unfortunately for some, the pacing can sometimes be broken by the short training arcs which are actually pretty entertaining and in many cases are segued in nicely with the story arcs. Also, there is only one short filler arc throughout the first 135 episodes.\n\nArt: 8\n\nFirst off, it should be apparent from our protagonists conspicuous appearance that, in many ways these guys are ninjas in name only. Still, the appearances of the characters throughout the series are so varied that I, at the very least, didn't care. Animation does take a dip occasionally, however.\n\nSound: 8\n\nOrochimaru is a plus, no doubt about that. And most of the other cast members have good voice acting, though Rock Lee's can sometimes be grating.. The music is pretty good, though occasionally generic.\n\nCharacter: 8\n\nDepending on how you take to Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura this could be your favorite part of the series, which is the case for me, or your least favorite, and probably game breaking, aspect of the series as it does depend upon these three for the vast majority of the story . But, I'm sure most people will like the supporting characters as almost all of them are developed to a satisfying degree. Unfortunately, all of them fit the tragic past stereotype so...your mileage may vary. You may want to avoid this series if you aren't a fan of melodrama.\n\nEnjoyment: 9\n\nHell yeah, I enjoyed this series. I won't lie, I loved this series. But, it certainly isn't for everyone and I can understand quite a few people being frustrated by this shows some times slow, often times fast pacing and some of the more dragged out arcs even frustrated me at times. Also, as I said before, enjoyment largely hinges on whether or not you take to the three main characters or not. \n\nOverall: 8\n\n To sum it up, don't go into Naruto expecting to see the tightest script ever written or anything thought provoking. Just go into it for a fun time and, maybe, you'll be surprised by the well developed characters like I was. Make no mistake, Naruto was a great experience for me..especially because I went into the series expecting it to be terrible and, by the time I realized it wasn't, I was enjoying the ride. \n\n*If you want to make any sort of comment, just drop by my profile. Criticism is welcome as this is my first review in quite a while and I went with a different style than I have in the past. Thanks for reading this review, I hope it helps anyone interested in this series.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Ston3_FreeN7 (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 19, 2008\n\ndonsanman\n\nNot Recommended\n\n ok so I've seen like 200+ series and i have to say that this is one pathetic series. i watched up to shippuden 50. im telling you nothing interesting happens, and like 90% of the series is filler anyway. \n\nthe plot is seriously lacking and its a pathetic excuse for a slice of life/action-drama type of show. im writing this for people who legitimately haven't seen the show but the series is just NOT worth the acclaim or watching at all. \n\nthe characters are even worse. you have your over-zealous,untalented guy who thinks he can do anything if he tries hard enough. . .and he\n\n...\n\njust so happens to get increasingly stronger enemies to fight along the way. than you have your emo broody guy who all the fan girls swoon over while he talks about how much he resents his brother and must AVENGE HIS CLAN! get over it already and last you have your naturally talented good girl who has a crush on the bad boy, even though its obvious he hates her and that the other guy would kill to have her. look people this has been done MILLIONS! of times before so please if you haven't seen the series don't watch it. it will waste days of your life away for nothing. . .literally the series will take up 88 hours of your life! thats over 3 and a half DAYS! you could have been doing something WAY more productive. hell, it doesn't even have to be productive. you could probably have a better time watching paint dry! listen to me people, for gods sake i only watched as far as i did out of obligation to finish a series i started but it wasn't worth it! so PLEASE heed my words and never ever watch this series of overrated garbage!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by donsanman (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 26, 2010\n\nmilkman57\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (180/220 eps)\n\n I've heard a lot of people call this the most overrated anime of all time.\n\nSo is it really?\n\nWell, that depends on who you ask. Me? I'm one of the guys who loves it. This is the anime that got me into anime in the first place. So why should you read my review as opposed to the hundred others? Because I'll try to show you both what everyone gripes about and what they love about the show. Bear with me on this review, as it will be a little long, but since the anime I'm reviewing is pretty long, I have a lot to cover.\n\nStory\n\n...\n\n(10/10) - Ok, a lot of people gripe about the story of Naruto, saying it's cliche, moves too slowly, isn't interesting, or whatever. I have to admit, some of these complaints are well-founded. So why did I give it a 10/10? Because the story is so complex and well-done. A lot of this won't become obvious until Naruto: Shippudden, but this is a review of the original series, so, I digress.\n\nNaruto is set in a fictional universe where Shinobi (Ninja) are basically the entire cast. Most Shinobi aren't mercenaries, but instead, fight to protect their village, and complete missions to earn money for it. The main character is one such Shinobi, name \"Naruto\" (hence, the name of the series). Naruto is a rebellious, disrespectful, punk, yet he still wants to become a great ninja. He even aspires to become \"Hokage\" (the lead ninja of his village). While this may sound pretty cliche, you'll quickly realize that Naruto has a long way to go before he has any hope of becoming Hokage.\n\nThis series goes through a lot of twists and turns. The story is too complicated to try to explain in this review, but the further along you go, you'll find that Naruto aspirations aren't easy to live up to. In the very first arc, Naruto and his companions are confronted by a powerful Shinobi who wants to kill the man they have been assigned to protect. The battle that ensued is what got me hooked on this show.\n\nThe fights in general are nothing short of brilliant. If you like action, this anime is for you! The battles will have you on the edge of your seat, and you won't be able to stop until you see how the fight is concluded. I also enjoy watching the characters learn new moves and apply them in combat situations. You'll see Naruto change from an annoying little punk, to a ninja who people actually start to respect for his perseverance and strength.\n\nNow, for the things people gripe about in this show. Oftentimes, a fight scene will be interrupted by a flashback or monologue, and this can get dull at times. I didn't mind so much the first time around, but it does hurt the rewatch value a bit. The story can move slowly at times, but most of the slowness is because of how complex the story truly is. The further you go, the deeper you'll see things get.\n\nAnother thing people gripe about is the length. While it's true that 220 episodes is quite an undertaking, it's really not necessary to watch more than the first 135 episodes. Yes, you heard me correctly friends. The last 85 episodes of the show are nothing but a desolate wasteland, inhabited by nothing but the pile of vomit known as \"filler\". I only watched the first 40 episodes of filler before I'd had enough, and skipped on to Shippudden. Some of the filler arcs are truly terrible. You'll sit back and wonder how the creators of the show had the audacity to slap the name \"Naruto\" to the garbage you've been viewing (if you're brave enough to bother watching it). Hence, my review only covers the non-filler portions of the show. Do yourself a favor and skip the filler. It really isn't worth your time.\n\nArt (7/10) - Here the show isn't as strong. While the art is never distinctly poor, it's also not great either. I suppose at times it can't be helped when making a series as long as this one. The animation is often stepped up for fights, or more intense parts of the show, which does help considerably. The art is at least passable, and I was never really bothered by it. Definitely not a show you watch for the eye-popping scenery, though.\n\nSound (7/10) - I must say that I really did enjoy the music at first. While it tended to use synthesizers a bit more than I cared for, it still distinctly fit the mood of the show. Some of the battle music was catchy, and managed to combine electric guitar with more traditional sounding string or wind instruments. However, the creators of the show didn't seem to think it was necessary to update their musical score once in awhile. This wouldn't have been a problem if the show wasn't 220 episodes long. Music that I had once enjoyed, began to grow a bit overused by the end of the series. It never grew to the point of bothering me, but had the show gone on much longer before the filler started, I might have thought differently. The music is good, just used for a few too many episodes.\n\nThe voice acting was easily good enough for me as well. Not outstanding, but never distinctly bad either. Just don't watch the dubbed version. Naruto's voice alone will be enough to drive you insane. \n\nCharacter (9/10) - Getting to know the cast can be a bit daunting at first. I've never taken the time to count, but there must be at least 30+ characters who get a decent amount of screen time in this show. While this sounds very cumbersome, it actually helps the show quite a bit. each character has their own unique back story and their own battle techniques. While one might think that ninja from a particular village all use the same techniques, this couldn't be further from the truth. The styles of combat are so diverse, that it makes for some VERY interesting fight sequences. Sometimes one character is at a distinct disadvantage, and is forced to out think his opponent in order to win. If it weren't for the brilliantly done fights and interesting characters, this show would lose a lot of it's value.\n\nThere is one drawback to all of these characters, though. Sometimes, a somewhat minor character will have a flashback in the middle of a fight. It does help to have some context for why they fight, but it gets old at times, especially if it's a minor character that no one really cares about. Despite this problem, the show does a good job of somehow making you hate a character in the beginning, and totally changing your opinion of them at one point or another. I can think of several examples of this.\n\nAnother problem is that some of the main characters (aka Naruto) are kind of annoying. Naruto is honestly a complete moron in the beginning, and you probably won't like him much at first. He gets better as things go along, but you'll still cringe at him a few times early on. Another annoying character is the lead female: Sakura. Sakura spends the entire series being obsessed with Sasuke (the third member of Naruto and Sakura's three-man team) and never really does anything worthwhile. She spends her time sitting on the sidelines of fights and cheering for Naruto and Sasuke (she gets better in Shippudden, but once again, this isn't a Shippudden review). While this didn't bother me at first, it got kind of annoying when all Sakura could do for the entire series was yell \"Sasuke, Sasuke!\" But anyway, moving right along. Their sensei, Kakashi, is very calm and cool, and helps to balance out this team of knuckleheads. Naruto's an idiot, Sakura's useless, and Sasuke's a child prodigy, yet somehow, Kakashi turns them into a functional ninja team. An impressive feat, if you ask me.\n\nTo sum it up, whatever shortcomings these characters have, you'll still find yourself rooting for them as they are put through fight after fight, trying to protect their village, the people they love, and what they believe in. For every character that annoys you, there will be at least one that you genuinely love. Even though I did a lot of complaining about the three central characters, I still found myself rather attached to them by the end of the series. The characters will do a good job of making you laugh throughout the series, and it helps to lighten the mood when you sometimes least expect it.\n\nAs you can see based on the 9/10 I gave the characters, I definitely grew to like them. Despite all the complaints people have, the characters are still very well done.\n\nEnjoyment (10/10) - It's hard to be objective on this part of the review. I enjoyed it tremendously, but there are plenty of people who don't. I'd say give it a chance and see what you think. You'll probably know whether or not you'll like the show after the first arc is finished, which is about 17 episodes.\n\nOverall (10/10)- Were we on a slightly more precise scale, I might give it a 9.5. I've already said that I enjoyed it a lot, but let me try to sum things up for you:\n\nPros: Lots of action! There are a lot of very well-done fights, which is one of the strongest points of the show. The characters are a good bit better than average, with a few annoying exceptions. The story is long, and complex, but very good.\n\nCons: It's a long anime. 135 episodes (non-filler) for just the original series is a sizable undertaking. Some of the main characters are a bit on the annoying side, and it takes a few episodes before they grow up a little. The long filler arc at the end also turns people off, especially those who feel compelled to watch an entire anime without skipping the filler. \n\nHopefully this helps!\n\nThanks for reading!

Sure there is Inuyasha and you can get your eyes clawed out by yaoi fangirls for calling them closet lesbians, but no other anime has started a craze of shut ins wearing orange sweatsuits and headbands to school like Naruto. \n\nSee, a uniform code is not just for keeping Crips and Bloods from wearing gang colors to school.\n\nNaruto\n\n...\n\nis about a Ninja named Eddie. No, he's named Naruto. He lives in a village where some great Ninja master gave his life to entrap an alien parasite into a carrier queen, I mean a Demon Fox into a baby's body. That baby is Naruto, a completely useless ninja who can summon the great power of the fox within. Think of him like a impish Goku, or maybe Ichigo--I don't know. Anime that go on forever all blend in for me.\n\nWhat is this all about, well it's the typical drawn out storyboard of characters growing up and becoming ninja. Doing Ninja missions (which are filler episodes) while the story dances around the plot that Sasuke is some talented Ninja with a traitor dick of a brother, some girl called Sakura, some short quiet Rei-clone of a girl whose name escapes me but I keep running into on gelbooru, and a sensei who loves kancho--but in the English dub the delightful Japanese pasttime of poking someone's asshole in a nonsexual way with your index finger is clearly unacceptable and heavily edited.\n\nHonestly there is no plot. Naruto is a loser, but he has a great power and a lot of the show is geared around how he takes a beating but when he unleashes that power, it is maximum. There's some effeminate snake ninja who plots to get revenge on the leaf village, molests Sasuke, gets pwnt only to return over and over again, there's Sakura being split whether to spread her legs for Sasuke or Naruto--but settling for some old woman instead.\n\nThis is your typical cliffhanger anime where you watch someone power up or prepare to unleash an ultimate technique for 20 minutes, then are forced to watch a filler episode before you see the obvious, with plot twists usually being mundane like \"the ninja training exam has been hijacked, oh noes!\" With that said, you'd think with over 200 episodes they could develop the characters, but strangely these kind of anime seem to be unable to do that--instead of relying on stock characters that don't really change over time (well, they can become more moody, evil, or slutty--but that isn't a dramatic and shattering change).\n\nI just have to concede that I don't understand this. And I also have to concede that I don't like this. Good drama and fiction doesn't spread itself so thin, becoming hopelessly lost in itself.\n\nAlso, for the love of God, don't dress up as Naruto.\n\nJust don't.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by tentacle_raep (\n28\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 3, 2008\n\nmcjazzman32\n\nRecommended\n\n Having watched many different series of anime, I can understand why the &quot;elitest&quot; out there give this series a bad review; however, I can also say they're flat out wrong and biased. Naruto is a fantastic anime that doesn't get due credit where it's deserved.\n\nFirst off, it's true that the fillers of this anime that take up about the last 1/3 of this Part 1 are flat out terrible. With the exception of the first two arcs (including the amazing Bikouchi retrieval arc) they're probably the worst anime I've ever seen and the fillers in Naruto Shippuden are just as bad. But I think as\n\n...\n\nanime watchers, we should recognize fillers when we see them and simply ignore them.\n\nThe anime itself is well-done with some of the most memorable tunes you will ever hear. I currently have one of the everyday tunes as my cellphone jingle - it's that catchy. The plot is original and fun, which is why Naruto has taken off to such enormous heights. The characters are all amazing and it's common knowledge that Kakashi and Itachi are two of the most bad-ass characters of all time in any anime. Everyone can find a character to relate to. From the lovable Rock Lee and Hinata to the inpalpable Gaara and Sasuke, we all find something to cheer for or hold onto in this anime, making it addicting.\n\n Those who give this anime a bad review refuse to acknowledge the points that make this one of the greatest and most popular anime of all time. It's their loss. Yu-Gi-Oh was the same way. You accept it or you don't, but if you don't like it, most people will disagree with you, which makes you wrong by consensus.\n\nTry the first 15 episodes and give it an honest try. By the time the Kakashi/Zabuza fight rolls around, you might just get hooked. Don't say I didn't warn you.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by mcjazzman32 (\n24\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 5, 2009\n\nwesley96\n\nRecommended\n\n Naruto is a hit or miss show. You love it, or you hate it. I mean, how many times have you heard from Narutards calling it &quot;the best anime ever&quot;? How many times have you heard from Naruto haters calling it &quot;the worst anime ever&quot;? Both have ruined the Naruto fan base, so now no one pays attention to Naruto anymore. I hope this review will get at least one person to try Naruto, even if it turns out they don't like it.\n\nThe story is basically about the main protagonist, Naruto Uzumaki, and his journey on becoming the greatest ninja in the Hidden Leaf Village.\n\n...\n\nNo one believes that Naruto can do this, seeing how this is because Naruto is a hooligan due to the loss of his parents at a young age, and how no one is friends with him because Naruto has a kyuubi, or demon fox, sealed inside of him that attacked the Hidden Leaf Village. Naruto isn't officially a ninja yet, so he takes the ninja test. He fails the test by his teacher, Iruka. Later, the other teacher in charge of the Ninja Academy, Mizuki, tells Naruto he can pass the test if he can get the ninja scroll, which is actually a scroll with every ninja jutsu known to man. Mizuki is actually taking the advantage of Naruto to take the scroll and destroy the Hidden Leaf Village. Iruka hears about this, and challenges Mizuki in combat, but is unable to win. Naruto then challenges Mizuki to combat after Iruka loses, even though Mizuki has the advantage, Naruto defeats Mizuki because he studied a technique in the scroll. Naruto is now able to not only clone himself with the jutsu, but able to clone about 100 of himself. Iruka then passes Naruto as a ninja, and is put in squads with Sakura Haruno, Sasuke Uchiha, and Kakashi Hatake, the team leader who is the second closest ninja in the whole series. After Naruto is put in squads, the series moves on to arcs, the Zabuza arc, the Chunin Exam arc (which basically every character in the Naruto series is introduced), the Orochimaru arc, the Jiraiya arc, and the Tsunade arc. All those arcs last up to episode 100. Even though Naruto has a basic story, each episode has it's own story to it, making each episode unique in it's own way. I therefore like Naruto's story because of this, which makes episode to episode enjoyable.\n\nThe art from Naruto isn't superb, but this probably because the anime was made in 2002. But this is an excuse, because the anime Fruits Basket was made a year before Naruto, and had superb art. The art looks basic, like One Piece and Bleach's art style. Naruto is a ninja anime, but if you couldn't tell already, none of the characters in Naruto look like ninjas. I mean, orange jumpsuits? Have you ever seen a ninja in an orange jumpsuit? Basically none of the characters wear black and cover their face with a mask, except for Kakashi, but that's his personal preference, not because the creator wanted one character to look like a ninja. Even though the art improved throughout the series, the animation still had plainness to it, so therefore I can't give the animation a great score.\n\nThe soundtrack that waws in Naruto was pretty good, and it fits in parts where it needed to be. A lot of people don't really enjoy the soundtrack, but I think the composers did a great job on the upbeat themes for combat and sad music for dramatic moments. And the voice acting was good for each character in both dubbed and subbed versions. Naruto has an arrogant whiny voice, Sakura has a self-sufficient bitchy voice, Sasuke has an assholish angry voice, and Kakashi has a leader-type of voice. I would go more on to voice acting of other characters, but there are too many characters to list.\n\nNow on to the characters. There are a lot of good characters in Naruto, but some characters ruin great parts of the show. Naruto is a great main protagonist, who won't stop until he gets what he wants. Kakashi is a great leader, and always puts others before himself. Both Hinata and Neji Hyuuga are great characters for being strongly developed with the story line and courageous, and Tenten for being the closest of a ninja in the anime. Now some of the characters I don't really like. Sakura is bitchy and whiny, all she does is &quot;ADORE&quot; Sasuke, and is a useless ninja. Ino Yamanaka, because she is the most useless character in almost any anime, and Shikamaru Nara, for being boring. Therefore the characters I didn't like didn't necessarily ruin the series, but it sure didn't improve it.\n\nI'm just going to say it, Naruto is one of my favorite animes, and almost my favorite anime series. Even though I didn't give everything a perfect score, there is one thing I can give a 10- enjoyment. I enjoyed almost every single bit of Naruto, all the way to episode 220. Naruto might not be perfect, but to me it was perfect enjoyment.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by wesley96 (\n13\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 30, 2007\n\nHuntsman\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (60/220 eps)\n\n This has to be one of the worst anime series I've seen, and I've seen 240 anime series. Now that's saying a lot.\n\nOk now on to some of the things that made it so bad. First is the so called story that's supposed to take place I guess two hundred years ago. Yet they have tv and radio, so when the heck is this anime supposed to take place. Now as for the story which makes no lick of sense to me revolves around Naruto, Sakura, and Sasuke on a journey to become the best ninjas. Which wouldn't have\n\n...\n\nbeen so bad had the creators focused on one type of anime instead of over blowing three of them from comedy, drama, action. Just focus one one and have the other two has secondary. Next lets move on to perhaps the worst part of the the show, the characters. I'll focus on Naruto. He is perhaps the most annoying main character I've seen in a anime series. Every episode I watched, I wanted him to die more and more, I couldn't look past him in the show. The other two main characters weren't nearly as bad as him, I might have given a little better score if they got rid of Naruto and focused on Sakura and Sasuke. Ok moving on to the so called action. First it's ridiculous, not very exciting, and drawn out through 2 to 3 episodes. Finally there's the length of the so called series. There's 240 episodes, plus another series, a few movies and some OVAs. I truly believe the creators and the company that own Naruto are just milking pre-teen and young teenagers of their and their parents money. Now don't get me wrong I know studios are trying to make money, but theirs a difference between making money and ripping people off.\n\nSo please don't support this show anymore.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Huntsman (\n51\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 11, 2009\n\nTheAoiDoragon\n\nRecommended\n\n Naruto, a lot of the new generations first favorite anime. It was not my first, I am with the last gen with Sailor Moon, DBZ and others. Naruto I started watching around... when it first came out. It was the first of it's kind, it lost spunk near the end, but it really kept you going for the first 135 episodes.\n\nStory:\n\nIt was different then most animes, people don't admit it, but it was. It wasn't always about Naruto though, which sometimes made me wonder why Kishimoto called it Naruto. The story follows mainly Team 7 (Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura) and the journeys they have until\n\n...\n\nSasuke starts to split, then it is about getting Sasuke back. The story is good, but reminds me of DBZ at times; too much talking, so the story takes a bit to be told. Despite that fact, the story still kept me interested until Sasuke finally left and then fillers. Those turned me off a bit, but I still finished it. (By the way, Shippuuden [Naruto part 2] is all about getting Sasuke back, if you didn't like that story, then don't bother watching Naruto Shippuuden)\n\nArt:\n\nA bit plan, but I liked how all the characters looked different. They all had different styles and designs to them. Rock Lee looked different from Orochimaru. Each character had distinct personalites to, but I'll get to that. The backgrounds were okay, but some looked great, like the Valley of The End where Naruto and Sasuke fought. I thought that was very interesting and symbolic.\n\nSound:\n\nIf you think of ninja music what do you think of? The music from Naruto. I think they really matched everything when it came to sound. The sound and music were the best bits from this show. Who ever this composer is, he made something out of himself because the show's music was much to its success as well as everything else.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThey are all different, I love that. Rock Lee has bushy eye brows, very positive and has simple eyes while Choji is huge, simple minded, and easily angered. Each character is different and that makes Naruto stand out to me. Some characters I didn't like, but every show has that. Naruto's character changes a lot and that bothered me through out this series, but overall, I still loved the characters.\n\nOverall:\n\nI loved this series, if you are going to watch it, watch until at least episode 135 and then, if you want, head to Shippuuden. I don't like Shippuuden very much, but if you gave Naruto all ten's, I highly recommend it.\n\n8/10\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheAoiDoragon (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 8, 2008\n\nTalamare\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Story: Naruto is a fairly decent anime that made quite a bit of mistakes, such as turning over half of the show into fillers, and taking the show into &quot;god&quot; level Dragon Ball Z style of fighting. Naruto starts out as a extremly good Ninja anime during its first season where everything you see is unexpected and the story is rather fresh and interesting, the first season including Zabuza had a perfect pace and the fight scenes felt truly of what ninjas should be.\n\n After the first season however we are left with a quickly declining anime, soon the fights becomes my &quot;special\n\n...\n\nmove is better then yours&quot; and it doesnt really feel like its a ninja show anymore with everyone pretty much using random attacks, which essentially turns this show into another beat em up. After a couple of seasons they start to follow in the footsteps of Dragon Ball Z.\n\nArt: The characters are well drawn, and the moves are flashy and nicely animated fight sequences.\n\nSound: While many of the music and songs of the anime are amazing, this show became plagued with... DATTEBAYO! ('Believe it' in english)\n\nCharacter: A large array of characters with each a rather decent background, however because they wanted each character to have such a rich and fulfilling history, we became flooded with flashbacks. Also only a few characters truly stand out in terms of growth and development such as Gaara, Neji, Shikamaru and a few others.\n\nEnjoyment: I decided to rate the seasons individually and then average them, with Season 1 and 5 recieving highest marks.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Talamare (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 17, 2008\n\nelc1247\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (120/220 eps)\n\n Wow... I look back and realize how painfully mediocre Naruto is compared to all the Anime I have watched recently... Its a shonen series, but it isnt really special... Just another addition to the &quot;boredom-inducing-fillertastic&quot; pile of anime in the end. It seems that many people have overrated this series because it was one of their first series, and they havent really watched many series anyways... -just a thought (All you hardcore fans keep reading, I explain myself)\n\nOverall: Naruto had the setup to be something epic, though the length and the way they tell the story completely destroyed what chance they had at becoming epic.\n\n...\n\nThey dragged out the story to include useless extra stuff, and though the characters had some depth, they kept trying to add more depth and not really adding much at all, just wasting time. The whole of Naruto is filled with episodes where you dont really get anywhere both in character development and story development, even the non-filler episodes did not do that well in developing the series in general. I admit, I liked watching Naruto at first, when I didnt really have much experience with much anime, now I look back and man does it look like crap compared to things like Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion or Tengen Toppan Gurren Lagann, or even Black Lagoon, I can understand why people that are fresh into anime are easily turned into &quot;Narutards&quot; now, just like the &quot;Pokemaniacs&quot; back in the day. This series is on a path that leads to a &quot;Inuyasha&quot; kind of standing.\n\nStory: Kid wants to be mayor of ninja town, ok thats nice, but has he REALLY gotten much further to ACTUALLY becoming &quot;Hokage&quot; in the last 200+ eps of this roundabout story? fillers killed what little naruto had in story. The way they stretched the story to encompass EVERY LITTLE THING is its main flaw, little side stories are nice and everything, but if you overdo it, you are just adding a giant mass of fat to the bone, no meat. If they just made Naruto something like a 2 season shot or something less then 50 episodes, then there might have been an epic anime that is worthy of being in the group of truly great anime.\n\nArt: meh... its not anywhere near as impressive as Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex with its 30million yen budget per episode, but it at least doesnt have any major flaws, though the art seems pretty bland sometimes, other times, the art is overly complex for what they are trying to show, but usually there isnt much of a problem in art.\n\nSound: i never really liked the kind of atmosphere that the background music made me feel, it wasnt epic, the background music didnt really fit the situations very well, for example the overpowering flute in most of the bmg and the apparent manly &quot;HUA!&quot; that is overused do not really set much of a mood, I understand that there is a theme towards more traditional Japanese type of music, but it doesnt work well in many cases, there are way too many times where it just wont set the mood right and they beat the crap out of the dead horse, its hard to explain very well, Im raising my score to a 5 because AKFG and Sambomaster sang openings for it and they worked well with the anime.\n\nCharacter: There is a very large cast in Naruto, though its usually a bad thing, they made it work somewhat. Even though the characters are somewhat deep, they all consist of cliched stereotypical shonen characters and do not have much to set them apart from the giant mass of other shonen story characters, also nothing EVER changes in the personality of the main character, Naruto, though he is cheerful, optimistic and energetic, he never realizes the reality he lives in and due to a lot of dumb luck and his gift of insane power he passes all his trials and tribulations, he is so naive that it is painful to watch, he almost never has a mature or realistic look on things, EXCEPT FOR HIS FEUD WITH SASUKE, even then he still does not have a mature attitude in many situations. His development is like Arika in &quot;Mai-Otome&quot;, painfully naive, though he doesnt even advance as far as Arika in maturing, at least she somewhat matured throughout the story. There are good characters in the mix, for example, Shikamaru and Garaa are pretty well developed characters that have promise. However with all that said, Naruto kills EVERYTHING in character, its amazing how dumb he is sometimes, dumb to the point where he should get himself checked for mild autism, unfortunately he usually blocks out the possibility of good mature side characters with his obnoxiousness. I guess there was more then one reason people tended to stay away from Naruto, besides the fact he has a fire fox's spirit sealed within him.\n\nEnjoyment: it was enjoyable when I started watching it and it stayed that way for about 100 episodes, then it just tanked... now I have no intention of taking this up again. The amount of entertainment is not enough to keep me interested, nothing like Detective Conan, which nearly only uses its entertainment value to keep me interested.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by elc1247 (\n16\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 5, 2012\n\ntaigataiga\n\nRecommended\n\n Naruto, who doesn't know about it? It's a wildly popular series that is controversial-- oh, almost every worldwide-known series is like that. First of all, i just don't get how people keep on complaining about this series. Like, those who gave this series a one-two-three ratings, i wonder what is wrong with them? They better came up with acceptable reasons. And oh-- maybe most of them thought that they're some sort of experts just because they've seen so many other animes besides this (even though they seriously can't make any better show-- note, MAKE-- than this show). I dislike those kinds of ppl that keeps\n\n...\n\non complaining due to some unclear reasons. And i know that this review might get me hated somehow, but whatever. Here are my thoughts.\n\nThe story is your stereotypical shounen-ish, capturing a parallel Ninja world, where almost everybody is a ninja and they have some cool superpowers (that's what i call), and there's this weak and stupid main character that eventually grows along the story. To me, the story is a masterpiece. Like, this is one of the first ninja shows at that time, and it pretty much introduced to us how are ninjas like. The main plot itself is unbelievably good (to me, dunno how everyone else feels), a boy that holds some kind of massive power inside of him that remains hidden, but at some moments it will come out. And i also love the idea of making 1-tailed, 2-tailed until 9-tailed monsters, that really got me. Aaand also the awesome techniques and awesome creatures. Until this point, i like almost everything from the story. It quickly catches our attention and it easily makes everyone to sit back and enjoy the show. I watched this show for the first time when i was 10, and like all kids, i instantly got hooked. Indeed, it has some undeniable flaws, like its cliche and guessable story, and maybe some spots of gary stu, to say. But, isn't that all shounen series all about? How the main character who was nothing in the beginning, began to grow and finally becomes something? It was okay enough for me. The fights themselves were also fun and made me eager to watch, and it's even okay to watch it again and again. It's never boring and to me, the story never grows old. Well, Naruto is one of my childhood memories so i might sounded a little bit biased. But that is to me.\n\nThe characters are-- god, there were like tons of them. Besides the main characters there were absolutely lots of supporting characters that appeared just in some stories and later never showed up again. I absolutely love the way they designed the characters with their unique traits, and note that the design has lots of varieties and i was never bored to see some new characters appearing because they're not the same, they're different. I sometimes thought how could ppl design so many people (because in my case, it's so hard to draw even 10 different faces). Well, Kishimoto looked really professional on designing the characters. Lots of different types of hairstyles (from the normal one until the absurd one), clothes (this one is definitely amusing), and so on. The animation itself is pretty colorful to me, and fight scenes (which is the soul of this series) were drawn neatly. And the sound effects--- for god's sake, i love the BGMs!! There are dozens-- or maybe more-- of sound effects, background musics, and opening-ending song in this anime. 220 episodes is not a short one, and they definitely made it not boring with the music. I could note some songs that i really like coming from Naruto. Toshiro Masuda really, really gave me the thrills with his awesome BGMs whenever we're watching some scenes and then dramatic BGMs that absolutely fits the story begins to play. Music is one of the best aspects in this series, tho. I even downloaded some of them to escort me on doing things. Yeah right.\n\nNaruto... is a really enjoyable series. Indeed, as i stated before, it's not perfect. No series are perfect. The best series ever known also came up with some minor flaws. And so is Naruto. Maybe you guys are irritated with the characters, or maybe the typical storyline, or maybe the absurd length of this series, you guys have your own opinions. I'm not a professional or whatsoever, i'm just an ordinary kid who enjoys watching animes. And these are my opinions.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by taigataiga (\n30\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 9, 2007\n\nVyraLove\n\nRecommended\n\n The mighty roar of a Kyubei vibrated throughout the area as a crowd of ninja from Konoha try their hardest to bring it to its knees. All the fighting is for naught until one person steps up and sacrifices himself to seal the Kyubei away. That man was known as the Fourth Hokage. Years later, a young orphan named Naruto causes much vandalism and trouble, just to get the attention he craves each day. His life goal is to become the next Hokage.\n\n\rKishimoto Masashi has brought us a very long series of action, drama, and comedy about a young ninja in training known as Naruto.\n\n...\n\nThis particular series focuses on the trials and tribulations of the young shounen who has only one life goal in mind: To become the greatest Hokage in Konoha village. Along with Naruto, he has a few friends who he has earned respect from. One such colleague is more of a mentor than a friend, and that certain person is Umino Iruka-sensei. Someone who was similar to Naruto when he was growing up, so he is the first person to understand what Naruto goes through. The next few are Uchiha Sasuke and Haruno Sakura, along with their sensei Hatake Kakashi.\n\n\rNow, onto the review of this long, magnificent-until-the-filler-starts series. \n\n\rThe animation of the show gets better by season, especially the opening sequence. The only qualm I have about the animation is the fighting sequences. More action, less stalemates, please. A stalemate is good now and then for a dramatic effect, but for nearly every fight starts to become tedious and boring. But I can work with it. It’s crisp and clear, and the designs of the scenery are refreshing because the structures of the villages are unique to their elemental area. Although the best designed character in my humble opinion has to be Temari and Shikamaru. Sure it is a bit of bias, but that’s only because those two are my favorite characters. Seriously, though. I like the thought of including a character such as Rock Lee to pay semi-homage to Bruce Lee.\n\n\rAlthough I don’t personally like the first opening song, it is a good theme for that season’s setting. The beat and rhythm of the song go well with the atmosphere, which is why it is a good pick by the Naruto crew. However I’ve listened to it too much and I don’t like it as much as when I had first heard it when I first started watching the show. I totally love the second opening song by my favorite J-Rock band Asian Kung-fu Generation. Again, it goes perfect with the atmosphere of the season and with the opening video animation. The third song is a good choice, however the singer is too high pitched to set the right mood of the song. It doesn’t mean I don’t like the song, though. I like it just fine. The singer is just too high pitched, is all. The rest of the songs are mostly J-Rock and their beats are very nice to follow. Fighting Dreamers, the fourth season opener is easy to sing along to, and that’s pretty nice. I won’t go into every single opener, so I’ll just move along to the actual soundtrack. The fighting music is good and gets you into the mood of the fight. Especially the fights Naruto participates in. That music theme is the most catchy that I have heard. But the most depressing fighting music is the theme that plays when the Hyuuga siblings duke it out in the Chuunin exams. It’s a touching match and the song really gets to you when you’re rooting for Hinata, or Neji, if you’re not fond of Hinata.\n\n\rAh, the story. It is a magnificent story to follow a young ninja warrior’s adventures to becoming Hokage and fulfilling various missions with his group. The most compelling story is the Missing Nin arc featuring Haku and Zabuza. Ah, shounen-ai; Just kidding. These two had a really strong bond with one another except Zabuza didn’t realize it until it was too late. This arc is also the arc where we first see a glimpse of Kyubei Naruto in his first form. Although there isn’t much to say about the main story because the filler takes up most of the series. 135-215, Eesh. That’s a lot of filler. I do have to say that the first few seasons are worth purchasing, though not to purchase the fillers.\n\n\rAh, the ever various and unique cast of Naruto. There is a character for everyone since the cast of Naruto is so vast; a character that eats a lot, to a lazy character who is a genius tactician. As I mentioned earlier, my favorite characters are Shikamaru and Temari, although Temari is from the Sand Village. \n\n\rOne could get a lot of value from this series; especially rewatch value as it is a very long series of 220 episodes. Well, less if you skip the filler, which is highly recommended you do if you rewatch the series, unless you find a filler arc you enjoy, then more power to you.\n\n\rI enjoyed this series, although to be honest I haven’t completed the 220 as of now, I still have 15 to watch to complete this 220 episode anime. That’s all for now.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by VyraLove (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 5, 2015\n\nKrystopher\n\nRecommended\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (126/220 eps)\n\n Naruto is my favorite anime series and manga series. I started reading the manga when I was a pre-teen but dropped it after a while, because certain story elements bothered me (such as Naruto's unrelenting love for his rival). However, when I was 17 I picked it up again because I was bored and had nothing to read, I was hooked all over again, part 2 starts slow but it picks up, and when I say that I mean it gets extremely epic and interesting. But this review is about Part 1, and the anime adaption of it.\n\nWell, part 1 Naruto tells\n\n...\n\nthe story of a young Tom Sawyer-ish trouble maker kid who wants to be a ninja. It doesn't take long for him to graduate ninja school and begin his journey to become a legendary shinobi, however it's not just Naruto to watch this show for, the supporting cast and antagonists, especially in Part 1, are what make this story shine. Some of the most beautifully sad stories I've ever read/seen (in this case seen) are depicted within this anime, and it's just an amazing story that no one should miss. It enthralled me as a child, and astounded me as an adult, the level of thought, symbolism, and hidden details within this story could only be crafted by geniuses, which would be Kishimoto and his editors.\n\nAll the characters are interesting, have unique personalities, sometime horrific pasts and secrets, and a good lot of them are extremely likable, such as everyone's favorite teacher Kakashi or the goofy underdog with passion Rock Lee. Even some of the most menacing antagonists you'd never think you'd care about, suddenly show that even they are worth your empathy. There's a good reason this is the biggest hit anime series to sweep america, and that's due to the overwhelmingly strong story, characters, and masterfully orchestrated soundtrack.\n\nNow, sure it's amazing, but there are negatives, most which are exclusive to the anime adaption and not the manga. While the anime adaption does a great job portraying the most important scenes, with fantastic animation and great music placement and sound, the entire thing isn't this way. This is because different directors and animation teams worked on different parts of the show, so one director could be brilliant, and one could have a lower budget and not be so brilliant, thus the art and execution are inconsistent in areas.\n\nThat's not the only negative however, this show has these annoying things called fillers, which are additional story arcs added on that weren't part of Kishimoto's original manga. These are pretty cheesy and badly written and should be skipped, except for a particular comedic episode about attempted to remove Kakashi's mask. If you want to enjoy the show to it's full potential these should be skipped, especially the huge lot of them towards the end.\n\nAnother thing is censorship. In the manga, there are some scenes that are just far to graphic for whatever timeslot the anime aired in Japan, such as a particular scene where a rogue shinobi is has naked corpses hung on the walls and is removing their limbs and dissecting them. Scenes like this are replaced with stuff that's less graphic but still sorta gets the point across.\n\nIt's a shame such a great anime with a strong soundtrack and legendary source material has such blaring issues, but that's what bumps it down to a 9, it isn't a perfect adaption, has inconsistent art (but great at times) and various other annoying changes or additions that hamper my enjoyment of the Naruto manga in motion.\n\nI recommend skipping the fillers for the best viewing experience, but regardless, this is a story you won't forget, with characters you won't forget, moments you won't forget, and feelings you won't forget.\n\nThere's no score more appropriate for this show other than a 9/10.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Krystopher (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 10, 2009\n\nBorisSoad\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (120/220 eps)\n\n Naruto was the first anime I ever watched. And I'm glad it was. Because if I had watched for example Death Note, I think I wouldn't still be watching anime. Why is that? Naruto isn't a 'hardcore' anime. It is just plain fun and everyone can understand the storyline. While some other animes may be confusing when you first watch them, Naruto is just clear. \n\nVery soon I realised what the power of Naruto was. It isn't the story, which is quite cool too, but it are the characters! Everyone has their own story and their own way of thinking. Their own powers and their\n\n...\n\nown weaknesses. This isn't something new in an anime, but Naruto does it in such a great way! It is really touching when someone is about to die, and you feel really glad if one of the main characters won a battle. \n\nWhat too is a great thing, is the whole world. The town feels realistic, although it is in a fantasy world. What I mean is that everything just feels natural and right. All the ninja ranks and how people treat eachother, it feels like a real but different world. The enviroment is beautiful too and is perfect for the battles which will take place there. \n\nI have been very, very positive untill now. The negative aspect of Naruto is that there are a lot of fillers. Sometimes they are just plain fun, but I really got annoyed when I found out that the episodes 120 untill about 200 are all just fillers! I quit watching and started Naruto Shippuden without missing anything of the plot.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone one who loves action-based animes. It is fun and probably one of the most ass-kicking animes!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by BorisSoad (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 4, 2008\n\nZecomm\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Naruto has to be the most over rated anime in existance.

In other words there were everything in this anime what necessary to a long anime like Naruto :) As i was watching it i didn't feel that it was waste i watched such a long anime. \n\nI liked Naruto's character so much. Naruto is a freaky, dumb and unlucky person who was always outcasted by the people in the village. However later he became a careful, strong guy who passes everyone's expection and surprise them. He's been helped by his friends and he's able to move forward by their assistance. He thinks Sasuke as a friend during\n\n...\n\nthe whole time what they spend together in the Team 7 it's (maybe) because Sasuke is also lonely after he lost his parents. I've learnt a lot from this anime. \n\nThe voice actors were great. Even though i was surprised that Takeuchi Junko is Naruto's voice still i think she is the best for Naruto. \n\nThe opening and ending songs fitted to the anime very well. Especially the FLOW songs. I liked almost all of the soundtracks in it. \n\nI like its grafic. I suppose it's unique. \n\nTo sum up i gave 9/10 to it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Su14 (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 15, 2022\n\nAmadeusCho2021\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n Uh what a bad anime.\n\nSTORY\n\nClassic zero to hero story.

If you've talked with your friends about anime, then the couple anime that everyone talks about are Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, Dragon Ball, and... Shingeki no Kyojin. What's the difference between Shingeki and the rest? Shingeki only has 25 episodes so far yet it's on par in popularity with the other super long, Americanized anime. Why is it popular? Well that's simply because it's stunningly amazing. Those people that call Shingeki no Kyojin \"overrated\" may not have the same taste as me, and that's perfectly fine, but in my honest opinion, Shingeki no Kyojin is\n\n...\n\none of if not the greatest anime to be made. It's not popular for no reason.\n\nThe story is one of the most captivating stories I've ever seen. 100 years prior to the start of the anime, humanity has been on the bridge of extinction due to the monstrous humanoid Titans that devour humans. Now, present day in the anime, the remaining small population of mankind lives confined within 3 \"heavenly\" walls that are so tall and sturdy that even the titans can't break in. The most outward wall was named, Wall Maria, the middle wall was named Wall Rose, and the most outward wall named Wall Sina. Unfortunately for mankind, a colossal titan, one that is even bigger than the 50 meter heavenly walls, breaks Wall Maria, allowing the other titans to rampage the city, thus leading to another massacre of mankind. During this massacre, our main characters, Eren Yeager and Mikasa Ackerman watch in horror as a horrifying titan rips their mother's head off, then gobbles her up whole. Vowing that he'd one day avenge mankind and exterminate all the titans, Eren Yeager trains to become a survey corp, brave heroic soldiers who go outside the walls, into the plains in order to fight the titans. But we soon find out, that Eren is much more special than he seems, not only is he a brave warrior, but he's also something else that could be the key to humanity's survival, but could also be humanity's destruction. \n\nMy 3-word thoughts on the anime: Epic, Dynamic, Masterpiece. The suspense build-up was absolutely amazing, yet there was still room for improvement; that shows just how epic this anime can get. The anime not only includes epic fights, but lots of dialogue, and for those of you that hate dialogue, I feel sorry for you people whom only watch for action. The anime includes lots of other things as well: there's lots of half-hearted, hilarious scenes, as well as sad, tragic scenes. The anime certainly has a good amount of gore, and will break your heart frequently (if you get attached to the characters). Many characters end up getting gobbled up mercilessly while trying to protect humanity in ways that are quite *shivers*. Have I teared up in the anime? As a matter of fact, I have. \n\nCharacters was another area (alongside every area) that was Shingeki's strongpoint. There's a diverse variety of characters that fight for humanity for all different reasons. There's trust, friendship, along with betrayals, and pains. There's comedy relief among many characters, especially Sasha \"Potato Girl\" Blouse. There are characters that people can definitely relate with, such as Armin Arlert, who wants to do the right thing and protect his friends, but can't seem to do much because of fear. Fear is something that haunts us all, and prevents us from doing things in life. Another character that people can somewhat relate with is Annie Leonhardt, who fights alongside humanity, yet fights opposed to humanity. What does that mean? Watch the anime. Why is she doing this? Because of her past scars, \"scars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real\" (watch to find out more). There were too many characters to development fully, but certainly the main characters were developed to their max. Levi is certainly a fan-favorite character, because of the fact that he's cool, overpowered, badass, kind-in-the-heart, smart, straight-to-the-point, and most of all, hilarious with all his neat-freakiness. The main character, Eren Yeager is strong-hearted, and \"special\", but he's still not strong enough to defeat the titans. How he develops is one of the most interesting things, in this interesting-things-packed anime. \n\nThe art and music can be described in one word: WOW! The art drawings were absolutely stunning! From the characters/titans to the setting of the story to all the equipment used in battle. The characters all had a unique aspect to them. The settings of the anime were beautiful. The cities, and walls looked realistic, the plains that characters dreamed of seeing made me want to run outside to see for myself how beautiful nature really is, and how humans under appreciate the naturality of nature. The 3-D gear was something that really caught my eye, and will certainly catch other people's eyes as well. A new form of action that's never been seen before. The characters would literally fly from rooftop to rooftop slicing their swords at the titans at high-speeds that keep the viewers eyes locked onto the screen at all times. The soundtrack in the anime was epic as shit. The openings speak for themselves, they do the anime justice. The openings were epic and certainly set the mood of what was to come from the anime. \"They're the prey, and we are the hunters!\" The rest of the soundtrack in the anime was okayasgduyasgda AMAZING. How can one describe how amazing those German OSTs were. They fit in perfectly with the epicness of the anime, and certianly added tons of suspense to the 3-D maneuver gear action. \n\nOf course, I may be over-thinking things, but the anime certainly included some themes while creating this masterpiece of an anime. The aspect of being confined in an area, doing the same daily routine every day. People seek to be free, and to seek adventure. Watch for this. Another theme that the anime incorporated was that of the cycle of life. Humans, we steal animals away from their families, we kill them, we eat them. What's so different from us, and the titans? The feelings of not being at the top of the food chain... Anyways, if you haven't already watched this anime and you're reading this review, then you've clearly been living under a rock all this time, and I definitely encourage you to watch this show even if it isn't your style of anime.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Sorrowful (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 7, 2014\n\nGladius650\n\nRecommended\n\n I started to follow the manga after watching the anime and quite frankly I don't see where and how the plot of Shingeki no Kyojin can suck, which in my humble opinion is awsome. You can understand the anime very well even without having read the manga. However, SNK isn't understood by many because it's a psychological manga .. SNK isn't just a succession of empty and meaningless clashes and, of uncontrolled violence, stereotyped heroes who fight the bad (like Bleach). Here are shown the darkest sides of the human psyche with great mastery: the desire to be the best but can't do it, the\n\n...\n\ndifference between men, their different modes of action (just think about the speech when Eren was discovered in which they show the reactions of the inhabitants of the inner walls Rose) and their motivations, some of the questionable actions that seems to be made in the right and instead the Justice of others that superficially seems foolish and petty (such as the choice of sending refugees to rebuild the wall Mary), freedom and the fact that they don't understand that what others inculcate to us sometimes are nothing more than mental cages. We stop at the appearances only because it suits us ( the walls is a symbol of that). Omitting the main and masterfully developed theme of \"Homo omini lupus\".\n\nIn this anime there are no heroes! There are not brave men, without fear, that kill all the wicked. Here there are people who are fighting against their own fear and that sometimes they make it and sometimes not. The enemies aren't the giants !Although the anime does not say from where they come from and I won't do spoilers, it's repeated several times that the enemies are the human beings with their fear (who have surrendered to the giants without doing anything, ignoring and accepting to live like cattle) and the walls! But no one notices that because it would be too challenging to make two questions and wondering: \"Why the walls ? Shouldn't they be their salvation?\" and get an answer.\n\nThe fact that many people aren't well characterized, and that physically are not very different from each other isn't a coincidence .. Isayama is putting on the same level all human beings, he is saying that we are all like that guy who shoots himself alone after he surrendered to fear, that we are all as Vernam (who during the attack fled from Trost ), that there is some of us who is better than others, but that we all live under the same fears, and even if we react differently, we act according to substantially the same nature. It still tells us that we might be the protagonists of our life, choosing our destiny, but only if we are ready to go beyond the stereotypes and mindsets that others impose to us, only if only if we work with all our strength. Because living by what others tell us, from what they show us, isn't to live, but survive!\n\nAnd in addition to all the various points of reflection that SNK has to offer (and there are many, not just those listed ), there is a plot full of twists and turns, the suspense. In short, it is a masterpiece. \n\nThen, if you are used to an anime where the bad guys magically becomes good after a lesson or in which the characters acquire super powers from nothing or from old men who appearing in their minds... Well, ok ...... that ... that's original and profound ........\n\n(Hope my english was not so bad) :)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Gladius650 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 8, 2014\n\nSonDavid\n\nRecommended\n\n In the 80's, Mobile Suit Gundam catapulted anime in Japan.\n\nIn the 90s, Dragon Ball Z broke the mainstream walls while Neon Genesis Evangelion opened the doors to the now indispensable late-night anime slots in Japan.\n\nIn the 2000s, Fullmetal Alchemist marked the peak of manga-to-anime adaptations while Code Geass & Death Note headed the class of those who introduced the new anti-hero genre.\n\nAnd now, in 2013, Attack on Titan has shaken the industry once again.\n\nUnless you've been living under a rock for the past 5 months, you should at least know what the story is about, and for the sake of staying spoiler free, I'm not\n\n...\n\ngoing into details on the plot.\n\nBefore I wrote this review, I wrote a different piece moments after watching the first episode stating that Attack on Titan had all the potential to become a landmark anime, knowing very little of how true that statement would turn out to be.\n\nI have watched anime ever since I can remember. I have seen the very best and the worst that this industry has to offer. And I, like most of you, am very familiar with the relationship of manga-anime adaptation, which is the case of Attack on Titan. It is because of such experience and knowledge that I am able to say with so much confidence that Attack on Titan is the best anime series ever produced from any standpoint, at least, in the last decade.\n\nAttack on Titan is such a well-done product that it has all the key strong points we all dream every series could have. By this I mean the story, characters, animation, OST, opening/ending sequences, art, directing, narrative, character development, and, most importantly, the \"it\" factor. These are all present with \"A grade\" production values. \n\nFirst of all, I want to start with the OST. Simply put, Attack on Titan's soundtrack rivals that of Rurouni Kenshin and Evangelion. Period. Don't misunderstand, they are not similar by any means, they are simply equally as masterful. Check on the internet the impressions left by fans about the first soundtrack. And if you still don't believe me, tweet Hideo Kojima (creator of Metal Gear series) and ask his take on it.\n\nThe OST is extremely important in this show because it allows you to feel the many epic moments that dwell in this 25 episode marvel. This is where the directing and narrative play a big role. For those of you who have seen Death Note (same director), you will feel an extra feeling of similarity with Attack on Titan, as the show relies heavily on its intense emotional scenes which you most certainly will feel the first 2 minutes of episode #1. \n\nIt is in these scenes where the golden cast of characters shine. I cannot stress enough how unique the characters are. You could say they are the cream of the many accolades that Attack on Titan has. I'm still amazed by the quality of voice actors that just seem to just pop out in this show. The voices of so many main characters from hit series come together in Attack on Titan to help provide that epic feeling you start to get once episode #1 ends. Note I emphasize the voice acting because it's part of the anime but, obviously, not of the manga. \n\nAnother key strong point is the work and effort put on the OP/ED sequences. If you've come this far in my review then you most likely understand when I say that Openings and Ending sequences are crucial. They provide that extra excitement to the show. It's definitely something not all anime series take seriously. Fortunately, Wit Studio took them seriously, and then came \"Guren no Yumiya\". The second opening, \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa\" is outstanding and marvelous in its own way and the second ending, \"great escape\", fuels that adrenaline rush of excitement you will get after those killing cliffhangers. Having said that, the first OP, \"Guren no Yumiya\", is simply epic. If there was ever something to describe as epic, it would be this OP. I am certain that as of today, it is the greatest anime opening ever. I'm amazed by the amount of attention it got on the internet and the hundreds of parodies derived from it. It was simply a treat to our eyes. The song. The animation in the opening. The sync between the two. Epic. \n\nYou won't be skipping that opening.\n\nIn addition, an animation production is never as close to perfection without the animation and art being top class. Now, Attack on Titan has astonishing art, to the point where you are amazed of how far animation has come. The scenes where there is sunlight will leave you speechless. The animation, unlike the other aspects, is where some disagree. The only thing I have to say is I was extremely impressed throughout the whole show until I saw a certain scene in episode #11 where the 3D maneuver gear was used, and I was stunned. I was simply stunned. Then, of course, later episodes also take it to a whole new level, but you're probably gonna be used to that quality of greatness by then.\n\nThat's how ridiculously good Attack on Titan is.\n\nNow, like the characters, the story is mostly work of the manga's author. This includes character development, which I believe is the key to the success and extreme popularity of the characters. Also, the story maybe the most original aspect of this series. Nothing you have seen before is in this show. Nothing. Much like EVA, Attack on Titan gives you a world of \"dystopia\", on-edge, and uncertainty, so full of potential that just when you think you have it figured it out, it turns around and leaves you speechless. \n\nOh, that will happen to you for the first time in episode #5. Guaranteed. \n\nFinally, even IF all these characteristics of an anime series are top notch, it won't amount to its potential if it doesn't have that \"IT\" factor. Some series have the \"IT\" factor without having all of these production values. They tend have 3 or 4 at most. Those become popular because they give out that feeling of \"amazing\". Gintama, the greatest gag series ever, comes to mind. Its anime doesn't have overwhelming OST, or eye popping animation; it does have A class characters and A class story (among others), but that \"IT\" factor takes it to another level. Now, imagine having practically everything an anime series has to offer in A class value while also having that \"IT\" factor. Extremely rare. Eva rare. FMA rare. Attack on Titan is part of that elite group. This is why its popularity rose to highs only few series reach.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever written a detailed review of an anime series. I did it because this one deserves it. It's The anime series of my adult era. I can now relate to those anime fans who watched Evangelion almost 20 years ago. They knew they had something special, just like we do now with Attack on Titan. \n\nIn conclusion, Attack on Titan is, of course, like MS Gundam, DBZ, EVA, FMA, Geass, and Death Note, not perfect. Like any other piece of greatness it does have its negatives. Having said that, when you add up the good and the bad, you end up with a landmark anime series that is currently shaking the industry with its mesmerizing, sensational, emotional, intense, and inspiring first season. Just imagine the wait and the hype for season 2. \n\nWhat kind of effect will Attack on Titan have on the anime/manga industry we love? Only time will tell...\n\nIn the meantime, this is simply the best anime series in the last 15 years. Enjoy.\n\nExquisite beyond words.\n\n101/100.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SonDavid (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 19, 2014\n\nKerma_\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Shingeki no Kyojin... Where do I start?\n\nIn summary, Shingeki no Kyojin is a perfect anime to get somebody who loves action started on anime- I think it is literally the most mainstream anime ever made, and that is definitely not a bad thing. But with this comes downsides- ones not apparent to the viewer at first glance, but looking back on it after watching it around the time it first came out, definitely shine through.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin starts off with a roar- the first 2 episodes explode right out of the gate with high-octane action that also leaves mystery to draw the viewer in. Who\n\n...\n\nare the titans? What is in the basement? Why is Eren's dad so creepy? All this and more the viewer asks themselves as the end credits roll for episode 2.\n\nThen episode 3 and 4 jump in. It's a training scene for Eren and his friends, and it's dead slow in comparison. But that's ok- it's episodes like this that reinforce character development and get the plot rolling. And soon, the episodes with action will begin again, right? That High-Octane, bloody, gory action we've all been waiting for!\n\nWell, it does. But then shortly after, it grinds back to a halt. Why do I bring up the first 5 episodes out of all things to mention about Shingeki no Kyojin? Because it perfectly frames the pacing of the entire anime. First you're baited with that sweet, bloody action that makes you just stare at the screen in amazement of the beautiful animation and heart-pumping soundtrack, and next thing you know you have to sit through an hour of people arguing over the same issue over and over before going back to the action. This would be fine and acceptable if it actually resulted in plot and character development going somewhere- but rarely this bickering between Armin and Eren result in anything productive.\n\nActually, Shingeki no Kyojin seems to show perfectly how to pull off the ILLUSION of plot and character development- Eren struggling with his inner demons despite somehow going back to square 1 every 5 episodes, the Basement which has been explicitly mentioned as having \"all the answers\" being completely forgotten about while the group goes out to hunt titans, and Armin rehashing what we already know to other characters every episode or two. All of this combined create a huge mess that on first glance seems like a deep and interesting story, but only through reflection of a different lens you begin to notice how shallow the pool you're standing in really is. The characters are shallow, the story tries to go somewhere but the characters almost seem to prevent it from moving at all, and at some points the story tries to go to too many places at once, just confusing the viewer until the next trippy action scene kicks in.\n\nI like to compare Shingeki no Kyojin to a Michael Bay film. This also makes it easier to understand what I'm trying to say (and trust me, it's not your fault- I have a hard time expressing what I feel in words sometimes).\n\nImagine Eren as Shia Labeouf, and Shingeki no Kyojin as a typical summer blockbuster by Michael Bay. Eren zips around the scenes of the movie, fighting bad-guys and pulling off amazing stunts with beautifully rendered graphics and an amazing ost- but then hardcut to Eren getting mad at himself and people around him but not actually advancing the plot for 1/3rd of the movie as the action grinds to a halt. Add some comedic relief (if you want a Bay comparison, the classic transformers out of place masturbation joke fits well) including possibly some potatoes after a traumatic scene and then slap on the illusion of having a deep plot and you have Shingeki no Kyojin. It's a typical summer blockbuster! You go in, watch it, enjoy it, then leave and forget about it! I'm really not saying you're not allowed to enjoy it because it's shallow and noisy, I'm just saying you shouldn't walk in expecting a revolutionary masterpiece of anime- which is what some critics are raising it up to be.\n\nSTORY- 4 : The story's foundations are put up well, but the actual progression falls flat as no questions are ever really answered and the plot never seems to want to go in a single direction.\n\nART- 9 : The art is amazing! There are some worse-off scenes and some animation glitches, but the art is one of the things that makes Shingeki no Kyojin stand out from the crowd. Even though I am not a huge fan of the anime itself, I have a massive poster above my computer of it as we speak.\n\nSOUND- 10 : While the music and sound design is generic at worst, it is composed beautifully and always reinforces the mood set out by the show. I would highly recommend a download of the OST.\n\nCHARACTER- 3 : Easily the worst part of Shingeki no Kyojin. Eren's constant back and forth attitude and behaviour that never goes anywhere, Armin's arguing with people that last an entire episode simply to recap what just happened on screen, Mikasa's constant fight to try and save everyone and pull everything together: it's just all poorly done.\n\nENJOYMENT- 6 : While watching Shingeki no Kyojin, I certainly enjoyed it- but I wouldn't say I enjoyed it the whole way through. Even while watching it, I noticed a lot of the fighting and arguing was going on too long, and let's not forget the 3-5 episodes of riding on horses. But the scenes that were enjoyable- notably the fight scenes and the pivotal plot twists certainly left a lot to talk about and were enjoyable enough to at least somewhat wipe away two annoying characters yelling at eachother on horses for 30 minutes.\n\nOVERALL- 5: Watch it, get what you get out of it, but don't walk in expecting the next amazing revolutionary anime. Expect a summer blockbuster.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kerma_ (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 4, 2014\n\nemberreviews\n\nRecommended\n\n Every once in a while, and even more frequently now than in the past, an anime appears that is completely and unequivocally shrouded in layers upon layers of hype and popularity from the anime community. It's the show that's on everyone lips, as well as everyone's TV screens. In the Fall of 2011, The Future Diary created an exceptional level of hype that had not been seen for quite some time. When the Summer of 2012 rolled along, it was time for Sword Art Online to take the spotlight, and its own popularity grew to\n\n...\n\nheights far beyond that of The Future Diary. Then, in the Spring of 2013, we were treated to what one could consider the Game of Thrones or the Breaking Bad of the anime industry in terms of sheer popularity; a show that completed engulfed the entire anime community, dwarfing even SAO in popularity, but is this anime truly worthy of the hype that it received?\n\n Our story is set in an alternate universe where, 100 years prior to the events of the story, giant humanoid creatures known as Titans appeared and began consuming and decimating the human population, though with no apparent purpose for doing so. In response, the remainder of humanity built three enormous, circular walls to encompass their entire population and keep the Titans at bay. In this world, we meet three young children Eren Yeager, his adopted sister Mikasa, and their friend Armin, as they live out their peaceful lives in the southernmost city at the edge of the outer wall, Wall Maria. This soon changes, however, when a 60-meter Titan smashes through the main gate of Wall Maria, allowing Titans to freely enter the city and devour every human in sight, and forcing those who lived in the outer districts to retreat behind Wall Rose. During the chaos, Eren witnesses his mother being eaten by a Titan, and now he, Mikasa, and Armin have joined the military in the hopes of acquiring the skills necessary to take vengeance on the creatures that destroyed their lives.\n\n This series, as a whole, has almost completely mastered the art of building suspense, mostly through the use of very long plot arcs. There always seems to be something constantly pushing towards a conclusion, but not actually getting there until several episode later, and that push factor creates a sensation of rarely ever wanting to stop watching for fear of the resolution being just after the episode you just watched. Additionally, this series is also a master of what I call the \"morale builder,\" something that Gurren Lagann has shown mastery of in the past, and there are dozens of moments throughout the series where, no matter how grim and horrifying the situation, it provides an uplifting or rallying feeling that both immerses you in the world its sets up and makes you root for our heroes to the bitter end.\n\n Speaking of grim and horrifying, that comparison to Game of Thrones earlier was far from being an off-handed comment. By this I mean that I hope you don't enjoy getting attached to characters, like I do, as you may find yourself curled up in a corner at some point. In the world of fiction, particularly in action series, there is a concept called \"plot armor,\" which basically means that characters who seem crucial to the plot's progression and the show's stability as a whole are protected from death or other nasty fates that might await them. In this regard, the plot armor for Attack on Titan is about as thick as a used piece of tin foil, and deaths of major characters are frequent and often times unrelenting. In regards to this, and on a more personal note, there are only three anime that have actually made me legitimately cry before. Two of them were KyoAni series, and the third was Attack on Titan. This show really does not care about who your favorite character is, and if you've made it this far without having had the major deaths in the series spoiled for you yet, then consider yourself lucky.\n\n Unfortunately, there is one minor flaw with this series. There are certain points, especially at some slightly slower moments in the series, where its gets a little too over-dramatic, to the point of almost being ridiculous. This was especially noticeable during what is now referred to as the \"Boulder Arc,\" which encompasses roughly episodes 10-12. These moments are few and far between however, and are immediately drowned out once the hype builds back up again.\n\n On the character front, for the sake of not getting your hopes up about the prospects of certain characters living, I'll talk only about the three main characters I mentioned earlier, with the knowledge that the rest of the cast, while incredibly massive in scale, still serves as a stellar group of vibrant personalities and ideals to create a surprisingly organic social environment. As for the big three, we'll start with Armin, who takes on the \"smart one/strategist\" archetype. While he is fairly generic and standard at the beginning of the series, we get to see him grow into being a more varied character at a constantly shifting rate, and his skills at strategy both on the battlefield and in complex conversations are practically unmatched, often allowing him the power to save the other two from the situations they get themselves into.\n\n Next is Mikasa, who, for the majority of the series, is portrayed as being essentially flawless, taking on the role of the unstoppable badass Titan slayer fresh out of training who also makes time to coddle her adoptive brother, and this flawlessness is built up to the point of it almost being a flaw in itself. There are, however, a few quirks to her personality that make her feel more human, but at the same time make her seem even more distant. Her only notable \"flaw\" seems to be her undying loyalty and devotion to Eren, often throwing caution to the wind and bolting out against orders in order to make sure he's safe. This also leads to some rather disquieting moments where her own sanity seems to abandon her and, to put it lightly, causes her to act excessively hostile towards anyone who means ill will towards Eren.\n\n Finally, we have Eren, our stereotypical \"perseverance\" character whose sole motivation for the majority of the season is taking revenge on the Titans, and while this does seem like a bit of a gaping flaw for the show's main character, it's actually both understandable and sort of refreshing. His intense focus on his own rage and desires for revenge slowly consumes part of who he is, which becomes especially present at several points throughout the series that I can't go further into detail on due to massive amounts of spoilers.\n\n The animation was produced by Wit Studios, a new studio that serves as a surrogate of Production I.G. Regardless of its heritage, for a new studio to create such a massively impressive project is beyond incredible. Not only is the animation well-polished, but it also carries its own distinctive style, most notably in the fact that its characters are heavily outlined in varying thicknesses of black to make them pop out from the background. Speaking of backgrounds, the environments are shown to be incredibly rich and detailed despite how unvaried they may appear on the surface, and the action shots give us plenty of different perspectives on this environment. As for the action itself, Wit Studios has no qualms at all with handing out incredible fight sequences by the barrel-full via an in-world tool used by humanity's military known as 3D Maneuver Gear, allowing us to break away from standard ground combat and enter the world of high-flying intensity, with soldiers bolting off of every building in sight, into the air above them, and landing blade-first on the neck of a Titan. On course, all of these brilliant combinations of animation are to be expected from Araki, who has already brought us both the intensely stylized atmosphere of Death Note and the blood-pumping action of Guilty Crown.\n\n The dub was produced by FUNimation, and, as someone who watched the subbed version first, I have no problems whatsoever recommending this dub. From heavy-hitting new favorites like Josh Grelle and Matthew Mercer to classic icons like Vic Mignogna and Caitlin Glass, Funimation has pulled out all the stop to create one of the best dubs this side of 2010. Grelle shuffles between nervously unstable and frantically stern for his portrayal as Armin, and Trina Nishimura pulls off both Mikasa's warmth and ferocity to near perfection. My only notable flaw with the dub is Bryce Papenbrook as Eren. To be fair, this is definitely Papenbrook's best performance yet, due in no small part to Mike McFarland's exceptional voice directing, but he does still tend to get a bit \"Bryce-y\" at some points and lets his excessively angsty style boil over, which is a rather dangerous idea considering Eren's character. Overall though, this is a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent dub.\n\n The music was composed by Hiroyuki Sawano (Aldnoah.Zero, Kill la Kill), and this soundtrack is definitely one of the best to come out of anime in a long time, based in heavy orchestrations and laced throughout with electronica and hard rock. From the bombastic explosions of \"E.M.A\" and main theme \"Attack on Titan\" to the insert tracks of \"The Reluctant Heroes\" and \"Doa,\" this soundtrack dabbles in the art of perfection on all fronts. If it seems like I'm being much more in-depth with the soundtrack than usual, it's because I've actually purchased the soundtrack on iTunes and have been listening to it practically non-stop, and I highly recommend making this purchase as well. Both opening themes, \"Guren no Yumiya\" and \"Jiyuu no Tsubasa,\" were performed by Linked Horizon and give us massive eruptions of heavy rock combined with brass and vocal choirs (and on a quick aside, I'm one of the few people that actually preferred the second theme more than the first, though the first still kicks all sorts of ass). The first ending theme \"Utsukushiki Zankoku na Sekai\" by Yoko Hikasa gives us a rolling ballad to play us out of each episode, while the second ending theme \"great escape\" by Cinema Staff blasts through with a heavy rock track. Additionally, all of these tracks except \"great escape\" are available for purchase on iTunes, purchases that I also highly recommend.\n\n Overall, Attack on Titan is simply an incredible experience, combining high-flying action that could even make ufotable nervous with a dark and nearly-overwhelming sense of fear and desperation, and this anime is more than deserving of the hype that it receives. However, as it stands right now, on November 4, 2014, the series is incomplete, and there has been no announcement of a second season yet. I highly doubt that this second season will never come however, and it has been reported that the original manga is planned to be finished in about four years’ time (which actually isn't that much material for a monthly manga). In the meantime, there will be plenty of specials and spin-offs to keep us satiated until season 2 is officially announced.\n\n Attack on Titan is currently licensed by FUNimation and is available from them for both streaming and purchase.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by emberreviews (\n25\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 29, 2013\n\nWandering-Otaku\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Attack on Titan is a particularly unique case for me. As such, my review needs to be broken up to properly analyze it. \n\nStory: \n\nAttack on Titan has an absolutely astounding setting. The sheer idea behind the setting, the exposition pieces, and the initial plot elements held the potential for it to be one of the best action anime ever. From the first three episodes, I could see how someone could believe this would be that one anime that is just absolutely amazing. It simply becomes disappointing as things continue. Long story short? The start is absolutely amazing. It's powerful. It's grabbing. It does everything\n\n...\n\nan introduction should do. The problem after that stems from the plot slowly becoming painfully predictable and a personal dissatisfaction with the protagonists in place as well as the decisions of various members of the cast completely destroying the story's credibility at times. \n\nArt:\n\nArt is completely subjective. I would not actually judge art based on someone's own opinion. You would really have to see it for yourself to deem whether it is \"good\" or not. As for me, it seemed fairly mediocre. The effort is there, but something with the art style simply does not jive with me. The settings are well done, but the characters are quite bland. \n\nSound:\n\nFinally. This is what I can praise Attack on Titan for. If anything, this series's soundtrack deserves to be remembered. It is excellent and its execution throughout the anime was not only strategic but tasteful. The tracks range from dark and depressing to powerful and moving pieces designed for a battle against a completely hopeless situation. In my opinion, the music in and of itself is the true beauty behind this anime. \n\nCharacters: \n\nThe main protagonist Eren Jeager is heavily set on his goal to a fault. Some call this good writing, but given the setting, it actually works against the story and its credibility. It is literally almost difficult to not find the main character's obsession with revenge nostalgic and downright hilarious. If you don't like avenger-type characters, you will despise Eren beyond imagination by the time the story is over. The worst part? He finally starts developing three-quarters through and goes right back to the bratty child he was in the first few eps. The same can be said of Mikasa. This anime is one of the few to portray women with some form of decency, but Mikasa's obsession with Eren is a pretty sad window of how the author wants people to worship his poorly-designed protagonist. To boot, Mikasa literally has no flaws other than her obsession with Eren. No character flaws. No ability flaws. Her only real flaw is her obsession with Eren, which usually only winds up helping them, not causing them problems like it should. Your only real likable protagonist? Armin. He is one of maybe three characters we really see that has a solid character, solid flaws, and solid development based on those flaws and his interactions with other characters due to the plot. In all honesty, Armin should have been the main protagonist. \n\nEnjoyment:\n\nNow we move onto enjoyment. Despite vehemently despising roughly eighty-five percent of the cast, I enjoyed Attack on Titan. Is it a great action anime? Sure. Definitely! Is it realistic? Sad to say, but no it is not. Is it the most well-written anime ever? Astronomically far from it. If you're looking for an action anime to sit down and enjoy, this is a wonderful choice. If you're looking for an action anime with a strong plot and emphasis on lovable characters, I recommend pretending that you never heard the hype and staying far away from this anime. \n\nWith a heavy heart, I cannot give the anime anything higher than a 5/10 in good conscience. It had oodles of potential, but an irritating cast, some half-baked plot elements, and predictability ruined it. Mediocre at best.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Wandering-Otaku (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 13, 2013\n\nXiaraith\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n So what on earth?

So I figured I would write a review on what has grown to be one of my favourite series of all time.\n\nWhat I've noticed is that people tend to be very split about this anime; you either love it, or you hate it. Clearly, in my case, I love this entire series (the show, the manga, the side-stories, etc.) Now onto the actual review.\n\nStory: 9\n\nAt its core, Shingeki no Kyojin is something that we have seen many times in the past: humanity is being attacked, therefore we\n\n...\n\nmust defend ourselves. Many, many iconic shows start from this format. However, SNK (as I will be calling it for the rest of the review) takes this simple plot point and expands it into something very, very unique. We have the Titans: giant, humanoid creatures set on devouring humans. Because of the Titans, humanity has been driven behind three walls, with the population dwindling to less than 1% of our current population. \n\nEach and every single plot point in this series is completely thought out and executed stunningly. There are so many twists that you won't be able to see coming. Hell, check out episode 8- you'll be shocked. Even the filler is thought out, and has important significance to the main story. The story of SNK goes even further in the manga. At the time of writing this review, there has been 59 chapters released, and we are just only starting to scratch the surface of this world.\n\nLike most things out there, SNK does have its flaws. But the flaws are so minuscule that it's very, very hard to notice them. The brilliant storytelling of this series completely blew me away from episode 1, which is why it deserves a near perfect score.\n\nArt: 9\n\nIf you have read the SNK manga, you'll know that the art, while it is good, isn't amazing. The anime cleaned up all of the character designs, leaving us with a beautiful result. While there were some minor changes in characters (ex Eren's eye colour, Levi's physique, etc,) the anime designs did stay pretty true to the original material. The designs match the characters' personalities completely, which is something that not a lot of shows can brag about.\n\nAnd the animation is breathtaking. Every single sky we see, the birds eye views; the scenery in this anime is absolutely stunning. And the animation for the characters and their situations is pretty great, too. To me, this is digital animation to the finest degree. But again, as is the case with most shows, SNK does have some animation flaws. For example, in one episode, the same frame is shown about three times. The characters can also have a case of \"far away face\", but that is pretty common. Again, these flaws in animation are pretty small, and are barely noticeable when you are watching the show. They do not take away from the rest of the show.\n\nSound: 10\n\nThe score for SNK was done by Hiroyuki Sawano. If you don't recognize his name, he also composed the score for things like Kill la Kill, Ao no Exorcist, and more recently Aldnoah.Zero. If I could use any one word to describe the sound of SNK, it would be flawless. The score matches every scene perfectly, mixing electronics with more orchestral pieces. If you don't have any interest in watching the show, I would still suggest you download the OSTs. The sound for this show blew me away. Even the background noises, the additional sound FX- they were all done to the utmost perfection.\n\nThe openings and endings for SNK were all absolutely amazing. It's no wonder that Guren no Yumiya in particular has landed on many \"top 10 anime openings\" lists. The songs will get stuck in your head, and refuse to leave. In my case, they have not left in a year, and that's something that is very hard to do in my case. Just check out the OPs and EDs online; you'll be amazed at how great they are.\n\nAnd the voice acting is nothing to laugh at, either. With many shows that I've seen, I've noticed that the voices don't match with the characters. Either the voice is too weak, too bold, meek, etc- this is not the case with SNK. Each character is voiced perfectly; each voice matches the personality of the character. The passion put into the voice acting of the show is nothing to laugh at. The voice actors were able to portray each and every line and emotion perfectly, which is something very hard to do. The dub is a different story (but we don't talk about the dub....)\n\nCharacter: 9\n\nThis is where most people decided whether they love or hate this show. To be fair, the characters in SNK can sometimes seem a little extreme with their personalities. However, I love them. For example, the main character Eren can seem very angry, very passionate. Some people hate this. They think he's just a trope amped up to the extreme. In my opinion, Eren's character was done perfectly. His \"extreme\" emotions fit his personality up to a T. \n\nThe personalities of each character in this show are fleshed out near perfectly, in my opinion. Again, some aspects can seem extreme, but that is part of the enjoyment of this series. Not one character is deemed as \"perfect.\" They each have their flaws, which makes them seem very human and realistic. As the story goes on, each point in each characters' personality is explained in detail, even if it seems unimportant initially.\n\nEach character in this series serves a purpose. The main characters, the main supporting characters, the regular supporting characters- each and every one of them is important. There is a lot of death in this show, but every single death we see is important to the story and the character development. And while some deaths may seem insignificant, they really aren't. The entire emotional journey of this series stems from the characters, and SNK has pretty powerful ones.\n\nEnjoyment: 10\n\nI'm not a fan of blood and gore. Really, I'm not. There have been several shows, live-action or animated, that I have had to drop because of their content. When a show like SNK, which has copious amounts of both blood and gore, can become one of my favourites, you know that it is amazing.\n\nEvery single episode of SNK had me captivated. Even the filler ones. Each and every episode was an emotional journey from start to finish. Waiting for the episodes to air every week was torture, because I so desperately wanted to see everything happen (even if I had already read the manga.) I loved every single episode, even the OVAs that have been released. Each release had me on edge, with both the show and the manga. Nothing was dull; everything was riveting.\n\nOverall: 9\n\nThere is a reason why this show doesn't score perfect. It has its flaws, as everything does. But there is also a reason why it scores so high.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin was one of the most popular, if not the MOST popular anime of 2013. There is a reason for this. There is a reason why so many people watch, read, and enjoy this series, even if they're not into anime or manga. There is a reason why there are copious amounts of fan works for this series. There is a reason why so much merchandise has been released. There is a reason why so many people cosplay characters from this series.\n\nLike it or hate it, you really can't deny how popular it is. I personally love everything about it. Keep in mind that this is only my opinion; other people will tell you different things. But to me, Shingeki no Kyojin is stunning.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by abrodkin (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 7, 2014\n\nMicsupreeme\n\nRecommended\n\n Let's get straight to it! Shingeki no Kyojin is an incredibly gripping, action packed show, and it is certainly capable of converting non-anime watchers. When you begin to understand the plight of humanity versus the titans, you'll quickly begin to realize that this is a show of epic proportions - essentially it is an inter species war: and violence comes hand in hand with this theme, so squeamish viewers might want to look elsewhere.\n\nThe show is incredibly engaging, and intense because the combat animations are executed perfectly, giving a really personal front row seat throughout. Not only this but peril is constantly a reinforced aspect\n\n...\n\nof the anime, and what's scarier is the accurate scale of death that isn't afraid to engulf those that the viewer has become connected to.\n\nI'm liking this logical order, because with death brings me to the next area i'd like to explain: Drama! Oh boy you'll be astounded by the dramatic, emotional and often angry outbursts of the characters. I personally would rank Shingeki no Kyojin highly in all of its presentation methods.\n\nBut that's not all, because in addition to being well presented, violent and dramatic, the show still then has the drive to steer you into corners via breakthroughs in the story. Another beautiful aspect of the show is that although the context would say that humanity had been surviving for over a century, the titans are still a great mystery to the present characters, therefore putting you (the viewer) on the front line for discovering more!\n\nDespite how i'm in awe with so many parts of the anime, the story if i'm honest is a bit too linear, as in i don't think enough goes on behind the scenes of titan combat. The plot summary introductions are also a pain due to their repetitiveness, it really is easy to pick up the story line behind the show, yet to an extent where it almost feels like it's been dumbed down.\n\nNevertheless, i agree with the masses, this popular anime lives up to its reputation, and you really must see for yourself!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Micsupreeme (\n60\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 22, 2015\n\nNikolekoleta\n\nRecommended\n\n This anime made my mouth open wide for longer than 5 seconds more than a handful times. This is the type of world where more people get killed than the entirety of the A Song of Ice and Fire series. It exists in a timeless universe – not in the past, present or future of our world, but in a pocket universe where Titans existed long before the existence of machines. In this world, machines were not invented to improve humanity’s lifestyle, but for the continuous existence of humanity itself.\n\nThere’s lots of shouting (especially from Eren), lots of action, lots of character development, and lots\n\n...\n\nof tears. My friends weren’t kidding. I felt like my ear drums would break from all the intense shouting. I think my mind is forever scarred, what with how everyone got crushed like ants all the time. And my heart has become immune to all other fictional deaths, what with all the deaths I’ve experienced just from this show alone.\n\nIt teaches you a lot about what it takes to be a soldier, a survivor. Constantly, people have to be reminded to “FIGHT!” Some lines are repeated all over the anime that it kind of becomes engraved into your head and heart once you’re done with it.\n\nIt’s the kind of anime that sticks with you, the kind that leaves you with phantom faces with phantom voices following you around, making you feel as if you’re still living in that universe, even after you’ve told yourself that you’re done with it.\n\nThe concept of the villain, and of the world itself, is scary and genius. First off, the villain – the Titan – is basically a stupid giant human cannibal.\n\nUnlike other villains, it doesn’t want revenge. It doesn’t want world domination. It doesn’t want power. It doesn’t need to eat. It has lived a hundred years without eating humans. But it is all it ever eats. It doesn’t eat animals. It wants only one thing – and this is just a theory, but it’s one that I can side with, and one that I love the most – to annihilate the existence of humanity.\n\nSecond, the fact that it looks human. It is, in every aspect, a human being, except for the fact that it doesn’t have two things; sexual organs, and a conscience. Countless times, characters had their feet rooted to the ground, unable to fight, and I think it’s because the image of a gigantic human biting off a human’s neck is just too fascinatingly cruel that they feel they cannot look away.\n\nThe world itself is scarier than the world of the Hunger Games. And I think what makes it scary is the fact that humanity has never won against the Titans, ever. For the past who-knows-how-many-years, Titans have been eating humans.\n\nThe humans in this world pretend that they have a system.\n\no matter what plan the humans think of, no matter how determined every single one of their skilled soldiers are, they will still be crushed in less than a second without remorse, without even a body to prove that you have existed. This is their anarchy, their ‘chaos’.\n\nEvery single man, woman and child in this world lived with losing a loved one as a social norm. It’s a dark fact I’d like everyone to consider. Everyone is already dead, in everyone else’s eyes. That’s what’s sad about this whole thing – even the humans think of other humans as just tiny insects with no importance. But it’s also beautiful, because sometimes, sometimes a character sees through that corrupted notion and calls everyone else out on it, making us realize it along the way too.\n\nSo you have a dark world, and an even darker society. Combine that with real-life everyday problems like corruption in the system, hierarchy in social status, differences in privileges and human rights and what do you get? Awesome badass characters who naiively try to fight against it.\n\nThe differences in character personality is great, too. There are a few who are extremely righteous, but most of them just really don’t care. They feign an act of indifference, but all for different reasons. But the fact that they had grieved over the death of a loved one united them.\n\nAnd I think that’s brilliant. These clashes of personality, and this unity for one tragedy, has bonded them together, and changed them greatly. You get to see how much they have grown in a span of 5-7 years. That’s something I don’t usually see in anime.\n\nYou also get to witness the amazing 3D Maneuver Gear.\n\nThis made the whole world look kind of sci-fi, but also, kind of not. The 3D Maneuver Gears are as close as we can get to a ‘high tech’ fictional gadget in this world. Every other man made thing you see in the anime is pretty mundane. But the function of it makes the people actually fly. It’s a pretty brilliant concept, and I like how something as complicated as that is a seemingly-ordinary thing for them. Plus, it makes the animation really cool to watch. You gotta respect the amount of effort (and physics, I bet) put just to make sure each maneuver looks even just a little legit.\n\nThe music is amazing, too. There were some points where I gaped like a fish because “wHaT just happened omg” and the music dramatically intensified my feelings. So kudos to that! The animation was splendid, hands down. Especially, like I said, with the whole 3D Maneuver thing.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Nikolekoleta (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 25, 2014\n\nShrabster\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n There’s a current trend that favors dark and edgy stories such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and so on. Anime, being no different, saw the much anticipated release of Attack on Titan which is based on the manga of the same name. Given the astronomical amount of hype behind the series it certainly had a lot to live up to. That said, the hype was understandable as Attack on Titan seemed to have everything going for it, being produced by Production I.G., having top notch production values, and a promising premise. \n\nAttack on Titan follows the story of Eren and the Survey Corps\n\n...\n\nas they fight for survival in a world where monstrous beings known as titans terrorize humanity.\n\nI was very intrigued by the premise of Attack on Titan. It’s definitely something that stands out and is at least somewhat unique in a sea of all too similar anime. That’s sadly where my praise ends for the series. Unfortunately the execution does not live up to the premise and it's not long before the show turns into glorified torture porn.\n\nThe majority of the characters are bland and pretty cookie cutter. This is a huge problem in a series where death and survival are the main aspects, and a character’s death has no impact unless the viewer is attached to them. Without spoiling too much there are one or more important characters that are introduced and die within the span of a single episode. The scenes are supposed to be impactful, yet these characters are barely shown in the one episode they are in creating little emotional payoff. \n\nEren has one emotion- anger, and only one way of expressing himself- yelling. Combined with his naive and arrogant attitude and inability to back much of it up, Eren can be a very annoying character. He never really learns from his mistakes nor do other characters react appropriately to it to any meaningful degree. Something that also shatters the illusion of suspense in the series is Eren's ability to shounen his way out of death avarious other situations because writing is hard to do. \n\nMikasa is Eren’s sister and plays the part of the cool heroine of few words. She succeeds at everything she does but her biggest accomplishment is being cute despite her manly abs. One could argue her weird and unhealthy obsession with her brother Eren is a flaw, but like most things out of Japan I just assume it's the creator's fetish. I guess it's okay though since she does look good in those tight pants.\n\nThe rest of the main cast consists of various other trainees and the Survey Corps. They aren’t really memorable and I couldn’t name more than a handful of them even if my life depended on it. There’s Armin, he’s not so good at fighting but he’s smart or so I'm told. There’s Levi, he’s kind of like Eren's mentor and a male version of Mikasa except for the part about wanting to bang Eren. Well, unless the shipping community has anything to say about it. \n\nThere are a few characters that I felt were somewhat more interesting. Sasha probably has the best characterization out of all the characters, or maybe I just like her potatoes. There is also Hange who has an obsession with studying the titans who also adds much needed personality to series. I think they provide the right amount of levity for the series. The other humor in the show doesn't work as well. It's a bit silly and contrived and interferes with the otherwise grim atmosphere and just makes things feel tonally inconsistent. Most stories do benefit from some type of levity and contrast, but it should be appropriate to tone and not take the viewer out of the story. A good example would be Paranoia Agent, there is an episode dedicated to three people trying to commit suicide that is quite humorous but stays in tune with the show's dark tone while also making for interesting social commentary on Japan's high suicide rate in real life, playing into the overarching themes of the series. It is natural and fits the show with its dry humor, in comparison Attack on Titan literally pulls you out of an serious scene for a cheap laugh, like Armin and Reiner gawking at a pretty blonde girl while they are running for their lives. \n\nThere are some other problems, such as pacing issues where the series just grinds to a screeching halt and drags on for a fair bit. A lot of other parts of the story dip into shounen levels of silliness and predictability. I’m still not entirely sure how the transformation aspect of the show works either, besides something about biting your thumb while you have some kind of goal in mind or something very ill thought out. I suppose these are things that aren’t meant to be looked into too deeply. The dialogue is also bad with the characters having to explain every little thing they do or have an internal monologue every five seconds for exposition's sake.\n\nThe production values of this show are good. The art and animation are nice and fluid, with the art style itself being very distinctive. The characters have an unusually thick border that outlines that's kind of unique. Character design is pretty good for what the show is trying to do, being more grounded and what not. The technology is pretty neat looking as well, from the 3D maneuver gear to the box cutter swords. The music doesn't thrill me as much as most but has some noteworthy pieces. It’s all fittingly high energy and I don’t have a problem with it. \n\nBy now it’s no secret that both the anime and manga versions of Attack on Titan are sweeping successes. Nearly everyone remotely interested in media has watched or has heard of it, including people that weren’t particularly big on anime to begin with. While its success with the mainstream market is commendable I can’t help but feel disappointed with the actual content. I can see Attack on Titan riding the hype wave with the support of the casual market for as long as it can. It doesn’t help that the creator is prostituting the series with several spinoffs, a live action movie, and even going as far as to change the original ending to pander to fans. It’s a shame really, I had high hopes for Attack on Titan but a few big missteps crushed those. Regrettably Attack on Titan will be a story of what could have been instead of what was.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Shrabster (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 21, 2014\n\nHatul\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n It's nice to have an anime this popular that isn't just tsundere school rom-com no' 10746 for a change. But does that alone make said anime great? No, not really.\n\nThis is a spoiler free review.\n\n*Story*\n\n*Insert synopsis here*\n\nAside from the monsters being replaced with Titans and the interesting weaponry the people have, we've definitely seen similar stories in anime before, whether it's Claymore, Blue Gender and maybe even Highschool of the Dead.\n\nLeaving that aside though, it doesn't do a very good job with its narrative. The story relies on coincidences, has forced exposition, uneventful pacing and it also has unexplored themes that are tossed away as\n\n...\n\nsoon as they're raised.\n\nThe setting in general is poorly explored. For example, they make it clear that there's a slave trade going on within these walls, but that issue is never raised again. Apparently they also have religious sects that worship these walls as deities or something, but that's never explored either, aside from killing them off in an ironic and disrespectful manner (hah! that'll teach those religious people for having faith and hope!). There are even social classes among citizens, and of course, the higher the class, the more evil you are (that's how it works in cliché land), but even that is just there to show us what good people the main characters are by comparison.. They also present corruption within the military and competition amongst its different branches. Granted, the latter is explored a little, but the former is hardly touched and is just there to shock you. So despite how rich the setting seems at first, at the end of the day all you will care for is the fight against the titans since the rest just remains background decoration.\n\nIt's a common thing to say that the first episode is Amazing, but I wasn't impressed. To me, the first episode is also the first mistake it made. It seemed deliberately rushed in an attempt to make the audience gasp at the sudden deaths of characters we know nothing about (pure shock effect). \n\nThis is the first mistake because the pacing does slow down significantly later on and I think the first episode was the only one worthy of getting fleshed out more, instead of diving in to the massacre straight away. The rest of the episodes don't even exploit most of their slow pacing very well. It has a habit of slowing down deliberately in order to end most episodes on a cliffhanger. Sure, it might raise the tension, but it also serves to make the series less eventful inside its already limited number of episodes (which means less of a story).\n\nAnd maybe I'm just nitpicking here, but the exposition insults me. It assumes I'm a retard who can't put 2 and 2 together and the characters have to go out of their way to explain things about their world that they should already know just by being born there. This show could've had no dialogue whatsoever and I still could've picked up on a great deal of what's going on. So the script just comes off as amaturish.\n\nAnd like I said, the story also relies on occurrences that are not very likely, but because it involves the main characters, anything is possible. It's nothing that bad or distracting, but I'm still gonna go on a limb here and say; that's not good storytelling.\n\nLastly, it just ends in the middle of nowhere and leaves you with nothing but another cliffhanger (surprise, surprise).\n\nTo be fair though, the setting is still pretty creative (as unexplored as it is) and it does do a decent job in foreshadowing some interesting plot twists and gradually revealing mysteries, mainly about the Titans. But that's pretty much it and even that is incomplete for now.\n\n*Characters*\n\nThese are tired shonen characters who are completely out of place.\n\nYou have a Mary Sue who's super strong for no good reason, the smart one and mr angry pants.\n\nGranted, Eren, the angry one has good reasons to be angry, it's completely understandable. Unfortunately, that's pretty much all he is and it's probably not the best idea to have him as a main character since it gets old really fast.\n\nYou also have Mikasa who's an absolute perfect being for some reason (I gave up on questioning it). We can't make her flawed of course since that'd mean she'll have room for character depth, we can't have that. And there's simply nothing to remember her for besides her relationship with Eren, being perfect and her sexy lips. So yeah, a lame character with no development and the most ludicrous backstory I've seen in a while, which also happens to be Eren's backstory. Which explains why she's his pet.\n\nNice..\n\nThe third character is Armin, the weak but smart one. I guess he's ok, since he does seem to grow more than the other two.. Aside from that he's forgettable as well since this show's characterization in general is very shonenish and obnoxious in an otherwise dark setting. \"The power of friendship!\" (ok, they don't actually say that, but they come pretty close).\n\nBy the way, these 3 characters are each supposed to complete each other with their traits, which is a nice idea, but that fact is stated directly to the viewer, much like everything else in this series (so much for subtlety).\n\nThere's also another notable character named Jean, who's kinda like the Vegeta or the rival in a shonen series. And much like Vegeta, he's the only one who goes through actual growth and he even reacts to the events in a way that resembles a human being. Too bad he wasn't the main character, he suits the grim setting much better than the others.\n\nThe secondary characters are defined mainly by their quirks or their looks and there are others who are just evil for the sake of being hated by the audience and aren't shown more than once. Many secondary characters aren't fleshed out and the vast majority of deaths in this series are of nameless characters or ones you don't remember. It's understandable considering the circumstances, but that just makes the main cast appear more plot armored than they already are. \n\nOn the other hand, the characterization of common people during the intense moments is pretty decent. Probably a little over the top at times, but I still think it was handled rather well with how they panic and such.\n\nOverall the characters could've been worse, I mean at least they have character consistency, they are given some focus and I should probably applaud them for not being overly sexualized, which is a very rare thing in anime these days. But I have no clue what people see in them since most of them are pretty simple and feel ridiculously out of place.\n\n*Art & Sound*\n\nI'll cover this part more briefly.\n\nThe character designs are kind of unique, I guess. I actually like the thick outlines the artwork has, you really don't see those much anymore. The surroundings look beautiful, both the forests and the towns. Everything just seems gigantic. The animation itself (while not always consistent) is great and the battles with the 3d camera movement is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen. Though I wasn't too thrilled about most of the Titan designs, and some are significantly cooler than others.\n\nThe opening song is arguably one of the best openings in recent years, it's just masterful (too bad opening 2 happened midway). Same goes for the soundtrack in general which is beautifully intense and makes everything seem more epic. The voice acting is nothing special and maybe even over the top, but I realize that the script probably told them to scream a lot, which is not always easy to pull off so give them some slack.\n\n*Enjoyment*\n\nI enjoyed some of it, but from a point on I mainly just watched it apathetically. I do concede that it's not a boring watch, that's for sure.\n\n*Overall* 6/10\n\nI've been mostly negative in this review, but to be fair it was still a fine show, or at least passable in some respects and the production values are great. But I doubt it will stand the test of time\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Hatul (\n28\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 28, 2014\n\nJarrbearr\n\nRecommended\n\n The hype of 2013 leading to an ending that closed off lots of action and questions throughout its run. With an anime that has a lot of hype, comes a lot of conflict between haters and people who genuine enjoy the anime. Shingeki no Kyojin is an anime that made peaks in sales and getting fans world wide, but is it really worth watching? \n\nThe concept of humanity being at the brink of extinction, this is one emphasizes it's fight for survival and the ups and downs of their fight for victory. With the first episode starting off with a great clincher to get you\n\n...\n\nexcited for the rest of series, you get a little view of how each character is and their view point towards the situation. \n\nDue to the story of humans being driven to extinction, you often get an anime that can be a hit or a miss depending on how they unravel it throughout the series. Humans are declining with titans appearing onto earth and they eventually make a wall tall enough to the point where even the tallest titan can't break through. \n\nWith the show being a fight for survival, it does an excellent job actually dragging out the battle to its actual length. With anime these days battle scenes are usually only an episode with the exception of it being mostly dialog. Attack on Titan has arcs of each fight against the titans or progress in the story. You're given arcs that focus on a battle to take back a city, an expedition outside the walls, and even a battle taking place inside their safest town. \n\nThroughout the anime you get stories of some characters past and they're definitely something that makes each character enjoyable and much more interesting to watch as the series progresses forward. The characters are mainly focuses on Eren, Mikasa and Armin. They're what drives the story and is the foundation for all the events that happen.\n\nYou have the main character Eren, a boy who does before he thinks. This often gets him into a lot of fights and is what drives his friends to do more than they expect they can do. With his mother being eaten in front of him, you get a lot of realism towards his feelings to the situation and an actual reason for his hate rather than the generic hero title.\n\nSecond you have Mikasa, a girl who is brave and does anything to protect Eren. They're not related, but they're brother and step-sister, but act just like siblings. They bicker and often get into fights due to different feelings and agreements. She's usually level-headed and very mature, but you'll see when something happens to Eren, she breaks down and becomes very agitated. \n\nLastly you have Armin, hes the brains of the group and emotional support for both of them. While lacking in physical strength he excels in strategy and decision making. While not being the main focus of the anime, he's probably the character with the most development. At the start hes weak and afraid, but towards the end he becomes mentally strong and definitely a changed person due to the events that occur to him and his friends.\n\nWith anime being military themed, you're given characters who are joined in with them due to squads and become their friends. You have characters who disagree with a lot of what they do, and some that are just like them and get along well. The side characters are also important for what happens and really drive the story with their back stories and talent that they bring to the group.\n\nKnown for having excellent art, I have nothing to say that can disagree with that. The art through the entire anime stays at top quality and even has detail in every aspect of the show. With all the scenery being changed constantly through the battles, you see buildings that were once standing being ruined and detail in everything. You can see the emotion on all of the characters faces as they witness their comrades being eaten alive. \n\nThe scenery seems to be staged in what seems like Europe, you see a lot of forests and old-style buildings. With all the scene changes you can see detail in everything such as trees, buildings and even the clothes that the characters wear. It makes it feel like the Middle Ages or so, with the wool and texture the clothes has.\n\nThanks to the theme of extiction, you get 2 wonderful openings to hype you for the anime. With the first half being set around emphasizing their survival, you get an opening that has lots of action and despair to give the feeling of struggle the characters are going through. The second half is more towards the counter attack that mankind has and their subtle victories and their path towards winning against the titans. The opening gives that feeling of excitement and shows their steps to becoming closer to surviving and prospering once again. With battles happening constantly and emotion going across the board with characters dying, or even victory, you get excellent background music to support those feelings even more. \n\nOverall this anime is something that lives up to its hype and does a good job having a really serious tone, but also giving off some comedy to balance it out. The story is something that has been done often, but this is one that emphasizes humanities survival. The art is top quality and is the best of the 2013 season to make every battle scene beautiful and movements very clean. The characters were all really well developed and really makes the viewer sad when they die, even though they've only just been introduced a few episodes ago. Anyone who enjoys an action or looking for a great anime to pass time, this is definitely worth checking out.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Jarrbearr (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 19, 2015\n\nleep11\n\nRecommended\n\n Shingeki no Kyojin is an amazingly written story with a very dark premise and a lot of action. This is definitely not a series for the faint of heart, especially those with fears of man-eating giants that don't even have the decency to kill you before they eat you (sometimes). The story keeps you guessing as it progresses, there's a new reveal that completely destroys what you thought you knew and makes you wonder just how far the rabbit hole goes. The characters are very relatable and you really do want to see them succeed. What makes this series unique however is the protagonists very\n\n...\n\nrarely ever win a battle. Every mission the cast engage in usually ends in a blood bath, but it's not without purpose. The gruesome deaths we witness just cements how high the stakes are in this story, and the determination of the protagonists to push forward is very inspiring.\n\nAnother unique thing about the cast is they are rather three-dimensional in comparison to a lot of anime and manga I've seen. Where I expect some characters to be completely flat jerkasses or emotionless bastards, there's always something that really makes you like them. The series also makes a point of establishing that no matter what you see on the outside, the characters certainly feel and act human deep down. This makes it really heart breaking when you see characters you like die in the line of duty, and only makes you want to see the good guys succeed all the more, which serves to make their victories so much sweeter.\n\ntl;dr, This series is a must-read/watch. If you have a weak stomach or a phobia for cannibalistic slasher smiles, give it a miss. Otherwise, give it your full attention.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by leep11 (\n12\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 27, 2014\n\nSorrow\n\nRecommended\n\n If you’re an anime or manga patron, you’ve more than likely heard of, if you haven’t already read or seen, a series entitled Shingeki no Kyojin (Attack on Titan). Based on the popular manga, Shingeki no Kyojin had been made into an anime in 2013, that had literally taken the entire world by storm. It's even been airing on American Television alongside other popular shows such as One Piece and Naruto. It’s popularity is getting to the point where it’s damn near impossible to say the word “anime” without someone bringing up Shingeki no Kyojin. But is Shingeki no Kyojin worth the hype? \n\nPlot: One-hundred\n\n...\n\nyears prior to the start of the series, mankind was plagued by their predators, The Titans, gigantic humanoid creatures whose only purpose in existence is to devour humans, despite having no apparent need to eat in order to survive. Humanity was driven to the brink of extinction. The few surviving humans built a society behind 50-meter walls that kept the Titans out. The walls were named Maria, the outermost wall, Rose, the middle, and Sina, the interior. There, humanity enjoyed a century of peace... Until... Our main characters, teenage boy Eren Yeager and his foster sister Mikasa Ackerman witness something horrific... The city's \"divine\" walls are destroyed by a colossal titan that appears out of thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother along with thousands of other humans are eaten alive. Eren vows to murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind. And so, mankind finds their secret weapon in defeating the Titans... \n\nFirst thing you may be wondering, is this anime as epic as everyone says it is, and is it filled with amazing action scenes? Well eh, I guess you could say that it's a tiny bit, not too much, but just a teeny bit ... IT'S DEFINITELY EPIC. This anime's introduction of the 3D maneuver gear was certainly an creative pleasant to the say the least, surprise. The way the characters jump/literally fly from rooftop to rooftop, swinging their dual swords at Titans, screaming their lungs at every second leaves the viewers mouths opened, and their eyes glued onto the screen. May I add that the soundtrack in this anime is arguably the best set of music in an anime ever. It's epic music certainly adds to the suspense of every single episode in Shingeki no Kyojin. The only thing I'd say took away from the EPICness in Shingeki, was that there was awfully too many dialogue scenes... Although some were pretty nerve-wrecking, others seemed to be useless and pointless.\n\nSecondly... is this plot depressing? Yup. Are there multiple scenes that have brought me to tears? Yup. Have I witnessed characters I love meet their end in horribly gruesome ways? Yup. This is not an anime for the faint-hearted. Shingeki no Kyojin will ruthlessly rip your heart out, throw it into a grinder, then turn it into processed dog food time after time after time ... after time again. This anime is also quite gory, so if you can't stand that, I'd... still recommend you to give Shingeki no Kyojin a try. \n\nAs for me, what I had wondered the most were, is this plot deep (theme)? efficiently written? And enjoyable to watch? Is there an explanation for everything that happens or is it one of those anime that something happens for no reason or leaves me going What happened to the _____ or how did he/she even know _____.\n\nThe storyline itself has no contradictions, is full to the brim with plot twists that are almost impossible to predict. And most importantly, it is VERY enjoyable to watch.\n\n(Skip if you don't care about historical information + deep themes) Well I will say that the plot has a deep theme. The circle of life and escaping every-day routine and achieving freedom (humans trapped within walls, never seeing the ocean, mountains, volcanoes, forests, plains, and never having an adventure until...) concept is included in the plot. What was also quite intriguing that you probably didn't know was in Shingeki no Kyojin was the use of Norse Allusions. Narrative tales for centuries have, for centuries, been borrowing and re-constructing myths from previous generations in order to create new tales to amuse and inspire. Mythology has been incorporated into many stories to provide emphasis on major themes and create a more complex universe for the reader to experience. “Shingeki no Kyojin” written by Hajime Isayama draws extensive inspiration Nordic myth such as Snorri’s “Gylfaginning” and “Prose Edda,” creating integral elements and parallels within the story by incorporating fundamental Norse ideologies into the fictional universe’s framework. It is these elements of inter-textuality that create a context in which hermetic moments can be experienced, while expressing creativity through the literary tradition of interpretation through connotation. As for the circle of life, humans for once are on the side of the preys. Why is it wrong for titans to eat us, while it's okay for us to (raise and) kill animals in order to eat them? In this world, the strong are the predators, and the weak are the preys. The strong steal all and win all, the weak get stolen from and lose all. That's just how this rotten world (in reality) works. The anime delves into the \"strength\" of humans vs the titans. Escaping everyday routine has been a theme in many famous stories, such as \"The Dubliners\" (read it, very famous). How can a person live when doing the same thing over... and over... and over everyday. How would you feel if you were confined within a small amount of space and never allowed to go outside of that tiny space because you would get eaten mercilessly by a predator out there?\n\nThe art and sound in the anime is absolutely spectacular. The soundtrack of Shingeki no Kyojin, composed by Hiruko Sawano is (insert the greatest positive word you can think of). The openings were absolutely incredible as well, and I'm sure that everyone, whether or not you've seen the anime has heard of and fairly enjoyed/absolutely loved the opening, \"Guren Yumiya\". I believe it's the most famous anime song ever. The art is fairly nicely drawn up, and the drawn up 3D maneuver gear certainly was well made. I must say in terms of visuals, the titans were drawn up to perfection! Their faces are disgustingly disfigured and what is up their skin/teeth! They look creepy as fuck, which is great! As for the characters, each person was fairly well drawn up... Although I wouldn't say great! and the horses/skies/plains (nature) was absolutely beautiful and realistically drawn. I must mention that the freedom of wing capes were quite desirable, very cool capes/art.\n\nEren is anything but a traditional protagonist. While a typical hero is driven by a great sense of morality, honor, pride, or a desire to make the world a better place for everyone’s sake and not just their own, Eren takes every stereotype and crushes it. Having lost his mother to Titian, monsters that he already despised to begin with, Eren’s motivation to join the military and eradicate the Titans are based purely on his bloodthirsty need for revenge, not his desire to improve the world. While it is true that he has expressed that he wants to see the world outside the walls, he didn’t really show initiative (his crazy hatred) until his mother died (although he did plan on joining the recon corps).Perhaps my favorite trait of Eren is that, even though he’s the main protagonist, he is pretty weak as a fighter. That is a quality that makes Eren very real. He’s not an overpowered main character; he’s human. He has powers, but his powers are pretty much the only reason he’s still alive. He’s not some kind of god, and he’s far from invincible. He’s, at the core, just a very angry boy that has lost his mother and wants to avenge her, and he does so with an unbreakable spirit. \n\nAs for Mikasa Ackerman, she is a quiet and withdrawn girl and maintains a near constant stoic expression, except when Eren is in danger. Mikasa's attachment to Eren may or not not go beyond feelings of siblings (well, she is adopted). Mikasa is one of those characters that people will love because first off she's beautiful, secondly she's funny and somewhat kind and mean at the same time, and to top it off, and last not but least she's the concrete definition of badass (kicks some Titan ass).\n\nLast but not least our 3rd main character Armin Arlert, a cowardly smart boy who possesses a sharp mind and a natural intuition for strategy which has proven useful on many occasions. Armin Arlert is a character that some will hate for his cowardice and \"no fightingness\" but others will like because he actually uses his brain, and you have to feel bad for him for being so very human (fear). \n\nWhy did I present dragging info on the characters? Because, their charactistics all add so much to the anime. All the other characters in Shingeki no Kyojin are quite likeable, it's just a shame that a lot of them will die out one by one before your eyes. And of course, I will have to mention Levi because he's obviously the most popular character in Shingeki no Kyojin. Why? Well because first of all, he's smart, secondly he's always composed, thirdly he kicks everyones ass, both humans and titans, fourthly he wants to protect people and is in a way a \"jesus\" figure to mankind, and lastly and most importantly, his fetish for always cleaning makes him a hilarious character. \n\nEven though the whole concept of naked giants devouring humans sounds a little weird at first, the main idea behind it (that is, humans not being on top of the food chain anymore) is pretty well done and the plot grows into an epic adventure that you would regret not watching. Overall the anime is very enjoyable and although some people may call it overrated (it can't be everyone's favorite anime...) I will tell you that you'd regret not watching it for sure. Epic is written all over the anime.\n\nConclusion: I guess it's a bit overrated considering it could become the most popular anime of all time, but it's certainly not as bad as a lot of haters claim it is. I guess the hate can't be helped though since with popularity and greatness comes hate. But, people can have different perspectives on things, that's what makes humans so great right? That concludes my review, thanks for reading!~\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Sorrow (\n32\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 25, 2015\n\nNameWithheld\n\nRecommended\n\n It pains me in a way to not give Attack on Titan anything but a 10. I completely understand why this show got so popular so fast. I also understand why everybody is impatiently waiting for season 2. I want to say that it is really as flawless as people say it is.\n\nBut I can't. While I would genuinely recommend this show, I am still a critic. I still have to acknowledge that this show has problems.\n\nAs good as this show is, and it is very, very good, I cannot with a good conscience say that it does not have glaring flaws. The biggest is\n\n...\n\nthe simple fact that this show has too much talk. I know that dialogue is crucial to telling a story and developing character, but there is a time and a place for it. There were several occasions where they have a really good story coming up in what should be the very next episode, but the show digs its heels into the ground and spends an entire episode talking about what was coming. It just seems like whenever this show can build up momentum, it feels the need to deploy the drag chute. This show is not nearly fast-paced enough. But this problem also appears within the action. There are so many five minute long conversations, or inner monologues, or flashback sessions smack in the middle of an action scene. The pacing of this show seriously needs work.\n\nThankfully, the good aspects of this show trump the bad ones hundredfold. The action is incredible, the art is distinctive, and the voice acting is some of the best that I have ever seen. Is it perfect? Absolutely not. But it is by all means worth watching.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by NameWithheld (\n33\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 1, 2014\n\nRi-chan\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (8/25 eps)\n\n I don't think this review will make me very popular, because I didn't really like Attack on Titan. The first time I tried watching it, I found the first episode so boring and discomforting that I stopped right there. However, as the hype increased and people were hailing it as the best anime of the season, I thought I should give it another shot. The next time I tried watching it, I got to about episode 10 and gave up again. It was too much of a struggle for me. Though after 10 episodes I had started to see the value of the show. \n\nStory:\n\n...\n\n6\n\nI'm sorry, I really am, but there are fundamental structure and pacing issues with AoT. The basic premise is fascinating—a post-apocalyptic world that was ravaged by an almost biblical plague. All of humanity trapped behind walls that are failing to protect them from the monsters outside—but it's execution is lacking. The world, which appears to be richly structured, is never actually elaborated upon: how did they build the walls? What type of social hierarchy exists as a result of the wall? It spends about three episodes on a single battle and then rushes through the training: we go through 5 years in a matter of 3 episodes and then spend another three episodes on what is about a 4 hour period. \n\nThere are also some bizarre story telling choices: [SPOILERS] the protagonist is dead for two whole episodes and in that time they decide it's the best moment to do a flashback to a different character's childhood, while we're still in the middle of a battle sequence. I don't care about her childhood and relationship with the main character: all of the characters are currently in mortal danger and the main character is dead. This is simply not the time. [END SPOILER] There are also general pacing issues: it feels slow, yet we aren't given time to get to know the characters so when the inevitably die, it's hard to really care. \n\nThe episodes also have a flat out depressing emotional arc. They start with a smidgen of hope that is just continually stomped down until the end of the episode. I'm sorry, but I like my characters to have a win at least SOME of the time. \n\nThere is also something lacking in the Titans as enemies. They aren't smart, quick, or focused. Watching battle sequences with them is like watching a bunch of flies swarm around someones head. It's just not very interesting. \n\nArt: 10\n\nThe art is outstanding. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. It's gorgeous. The backgrounds are rich, the motion is fluid, and the characters just look good. There is CG, but it's well integrated, and the colors are appealing and appropriate. The only caveat I might have is that it's sometimes a little hard to tell characters apart (but when there as many of them as there in AoT, it's inevitably difficult). \n\nSound: 9\n\nThe soundtrack is appropriate and distinctive, the voice acting is strong, and the sound effects don't sound unnatural. I only knocked a point off because the opening theme is sometimes a bit much (I was skipping it by episode 3).\n\nCharacter: 7\n\nEren is just not a very engaging protagonist. He's a jerk from the moment we meet him, and it feels like he's a jerk for no good reason. He then \"redeems\" himself by deciding to commit his life to a suicidal pursuit of revenge. I found it's tough to appreciate his character, though I did enjoy his inspirational qualities and his defiance of the hopeless state of humanity. \n\nThe side character come off as rather flat. They almost all fit into stereotypes that have predictable story lines. I do enjoy Jean, though, and I would be curious to see if he becomes the essential ally to Eren that I suspect him to be. \n\nEnjoyment: 6\n\nIt was fun on occasion, but overall it was not very enjoyable or challenging. \n\nOverall: 7\n\nThis is definitely a good series—and for those who enjoy dark, battle driven series, particularly fantasy, I highly suggest it (though I warn that I loved Code Geass, another dark, battle driven series, but disliked this). I hesitate, however to call it great.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Ri-chan (\n18\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 15, 2014\n\nthemegamancave\n\nRecommended\n\n This will be my first ever review on this website, and I figured it best to start with the one series most fresh in my mind. Attack on Titan was one of the most rewarding anime experiences I've ever had. Unique premise, serious characters and a vivid soundtrack and art style make the first season of this show one to remember. I will keep this review spoiler free, as to not ruin the experience for anyone else.\n\nSometimes animes will fall into the trap of taking themselves too seriously. The main difference about AOT is that it deserves the afforementioned comment. \n\n...\n\nHumanity is on the brink of extinction, being overrun by several meter tall human-like \"titans\" that terrorize and eat humans for just the pleasure of it. Humankind has succumbed to building three giant walls to protect themselves against the giants, and all was safe and sound....until the first wall was breached by an abnormally gigantic Titan, allowing the smaller ones to get in and annihilate the city. Eventually the invasion stopped, but the damage had already been done... The number of casualties was astronomical. The story continues by following Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert as they join the military in hopes of avenging the titan's invasion and The death of Eren's mother. Throughout the series, their efforts are pivotal in regaining a stronghold in the apocalyptic world.\n\nOne thing I love and hate about this series is the character development. It's just so damn good. At the same token, it occasionally feels so gut punching when a new character's past is explained, and then they are soon after another casualty in the struggle to survive. The amount of emotions that are invoked while one watches AOT are tremendous. I often found myself speaking out loud during a characters close brush with death or laughing during one of Sasha's hungry outbursts. The story in itself is also unique. I had been hearing wayyyy too many of the same plots floating around recently, so it was a breath of fresh air to experience AOT firsthand... At the recommendation of so many friends. \n\nThe art style depicted in this series is also quite incredible. Influences by Claymore and Casshern Sins are apparent, drawing from past experience of AOTs writer, Yasuko Kobayashi. I love how dark and gritty the character models can be, and how vivid the backgrounds are drawn. The music is also epic and fanfareish. The 2 openings also represent the growth of the story and are both extremely catchy.\n\nIn a nutshell, AOT is an anime not to be missed by any fan, especially if you love action and greatly developed characters. I can't wait until the second season rolls our way soon.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by themegamancave (\n77\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 22, 2014\n\nwalrusking14\n\nRecommended\n\n What would happen if humanity was no longer on the top of the food chain? How would we adapt, and how would our perception of the world change? Tetsurō Araki came to answer these questions with the release of his latest series. It is a tale of tragedy and revenge; of uplifting hope and crushing sadness. A love letter to the struggle of humanity and its destructive nature. This is Attack On Titan.\n\nSetting:\n\nThe exact location and time place of AOT is unknown, but based off of the clothing, architectural style and character names it is safe to say that the\n\n...\n\nseries is located around Germany and takes place during the 17th century. Humanity has locked itself away behind three impossibly tall walls named Maria, Rose and Sina. After the outer most wall, Maria is assaulted and damaged titans flood in, starting our tale of woe.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story of AOT is quite simple, but not in a bad way. Yasuko Kobayashi (the anime writer) didn't over complicate the plot with half baked symbolism or conspiracy pandering. AOT knows exactly where it wants to go and doesn't waste any time getting there. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying the series is dull, far from it actually; I just find it refreshing to watch a show that doesn't spend the first half trying to convince about me how cool and artsy it is. I knew exactly what I was getting, and AOT never changed that. In addition to the narrative, the actual setting is wonderfully crafted. While removed from reality AOT never strays to far from the believable. Everything fits from a historical point of view; the powerful religious presence, the centralized political structure, the proper use of period weaponry. The only problem with the story its pacing. While fine for most the show it does tend to drag between episodes 10-15. The show presents our characters with a simple task that takes them far too long to complete. \n\nOn a side note I found a lot of similarities between AOT and the average mecha story line. While AOT is leaps and bounds over most generic mechas I couldn't help, but make some connections. Angry new-comer discovers hidden robot (titan power), uses robot to avenge loved one, fights others with similar robots, gets butt whooped, gets stronger, defeats opponent, rinse and repeat. I just thought it was an interesting notion.\n\nArt:\n\nI'll start off this section by saying that, for the most part, AOT was animated by a brand new studio with no other anime under its belt. Studio Wit is a surrogate of the well know studio Production I.G.; so its member clearly have experience, but until AOT they had never worked directly on a project as a singular group. So with this in mind it is literally astonishing how much quality this show has. Seriously, if Attack On Titan were a fruit it would be dripping with the succulent juices of grandeur. Most shows allocate their budgets to the most \"important\" parts of each episode, i.e. the action scenes. In turn this causes most of the scenes involving dialogue and plot development to come off as unimportant and lack luster; when in reality these scene are just as, if not more, important than the ones involving action. However, the animation for AOT never falters; each scene is given the same amount of care as the others. In addition, this show has an air of excitement about it. I could tell AOT was more than just another job to Studio Wit; they truly care about this series.\n\nNot only is the animation beautiful, the art style itself is brilliant. The varying thicknesses of black borders around each character and object helps to add an increased field of depth during scenes of rapid movement. This creates a sense of urgency whenever the characters use their 3DM/ODM gear, only maximizing the excitement the show puts off. The art of AOT is perfect, literally.\n\nSound:\n\nThe OST for Attack On Titan should be used as model to teach young composers about the necessary elements that make up a great soundtrack. While not perfect, the OST hits every note it needs to, and then continues on to become even better than required. Even though all the tracks are great in their own right; a few of them managed to reach the \"anime peak of greatness status\". Those would include the two openings of the series. Which are easily up there with \"Cowboy Bebop\" and \"Baccano!\" (btw second opening is best....let the fighting ensue). Sound design on the other hand sits right at the average mark. Most of the sounds are over used, and were never that great to start. So, after a while it can leave a bad taste in your mouth. It works for what it is, but isn't anything to write home about.\n\nAs the astute reader you are, I'm sure you have figured out that I will always watch the English dub if available. So how is the Attack On Titan dub? The best way to describe it would be unique. I say that, because some of the voice actors Funimation picked require a certain taste. For example, Bryce Papenbrook choose voice Eren in a very forceful manner. It reminds me how most people sound when they smash their toe; jaw clinched with a slight growl in their voice. Personally, I rather enjoyed the English dub, but I understand that I am in the minority of this one. I would recommend to watch the first four episodes in dub, and decide where to go from there.\n\nCharacters:\n\nIn the character department I would compare AOT to the critically acclaimed video game \"The Last Of Us\". I understand that not everyone is a gamer as I am, but just bare with me here. The characters in both of these are as unoriginal as they come. However, they weave such a unique story and have such interesting development, that in turn, they become fresh and a great enjoyment to watch. Some of the development is a bit rushed at times, but it always comes from a natural progression and doesn't feel forced in the slightest. As any anime junkie would know, that is an accomplishment on its own; especially in this sea of generic rom-coms and forced love triangles. My main complaint is the lack of development for side characters. Some get their deserved screen time, but others only receive some kind of goofy quirk as to be memorable without actually accomplishing anything. We have potato girl (Sasha), bald dude (Connie) and freckles kid (Marco). I want to know their stories and what kind of people they are beyond their stereotypical traits.\n\nPersonal Enjoyment/Overall:\n\nAll flaws aside, Attack On Titan is one of the most entertaining shows I ever had the pleasure of watching; I can't wait of season 2 to be released. The action is exciting, the story is tense and the animation is beautiful. I give it a rating of Must Watch on my scale of recommendation.\n\nMasterpiece-Best\n\nMust Watch\n\nWatch\n\nTry The First Couple Episodes\n\nSkip It\n\nRun For Your Life-Worst \n\nAs usual I recommend you buy a copy, and help support our local dubbing companies and the anime industry as a whole. However, just taking the time to watch it is of greater importance.\n\nAs a final statement I recommend that you take my numerical scores with a grain of salt; as numerical scores are easily skewed and each person has their own understanding of the 1-10 scale.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by walrusking14 (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 29, 2013\n\ntehnominator\n\nRecommended\n\n If there was ever an anime experience that would leave you needing therapy, marathon-watching Shingeki no Kyojin is it. Perhaps this is the best way to watch this series; by the end, you'd be so emotionally exhausted and mangled, you'll know what total despair is like. Not since Berserk have I seen an anime capable of utterly destroying... hope. Yet in spite of its soul-crushing hopelessness, Shingeki no Kyojin is entirely about hope. Without it, mankind would have nothing.\n\nIn this world, giants roam the land. These \"titans\" (as it's been anglicised) prey on human beings. They are brutal, violent and unstoppable. Their arrival is as\n\n...\n\nmysterious as their motives. They do not eat to live. They do not eat anything else. They consume human beings and vomit them out. Humans have become worse than livestock on the food chain. At least sheep or cows are eaten for a reason. There is no discernible purpose for why the titans eat humans. They just do, and living with this fear and confusion behind the giant walls of the last known stronghold is the dwindled population of all of humanity. They've been able to keep the titans out for over a hundred years. Life in a cage, but life nonetheless.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin begins with the protagonist Eren Jaeger questioning whether this kind of life is worth it. Freedom does not mean breathing boxed in, awaiting death. That's not life and he vows to use whatever power he has to fight the titans. With him is Mikasa, a girl adopted by his family, and his friend Armin. While Eren is strong-willed and rash, Mikasa is calculated and fierce and Armin is thoughtful and soft-hearted; the trio play off one another's strengths and weaknesses in order to survive. And this anime becomes a war for survival.\n\nEren makes for a dependable protagonist. He carries the series well, despite having some \"shounen hero\" tendencies but perhaps his enthusiasm is necessary in a world where people drop their swords and flee in the face of danger or who opt to police within the safe walls of the rich inner cities. However, Mikasa is probably the show's great hero. Powerful, naturally gifted and determined, she carries Eren whenever he falls. As he is her only family, she is terribly protective of him. She lives entirely for him, and this may seem to be the only detriment to her character, but her loyalty to him is understandable when you learn of their past. Armin will be nobody's favourite off the bat. Wimpy, small and unable to fight, he has developed his intellect instead. The other characters are well-crafted and have distinct personalities (though they are just as many \"Who's that again?\" ones as well). Some of the stand-outs are Levi, a very short, extremely experienced and talented captain, Sasha, a girl who seems to gladly choose getting punched in the face by her superiors if it means she can get a potato, Annie, who like Mikasa is very strong and capable, and Jean, a spoiled and cowardly soldier who eventually becomes someone whose growth you can possibly be proud of. It's easy to like them... but maybe it's not entirely wise.\n\nOne of Shingeki no Kyojin's characteristics is that nothing and nobody is safe. It is not afraid of itself. It does not shy away from brutalising its audience or characters because honestly, this is a horrible place and time to be alive. It constantly reminds you of human mortality and fragility. Some people might tell you \"don't get attached to anyone\". Sound advice, but you won't take it. The characters in this series are constructed so well that you will root for them as they pick up their swords and then cry out in disbelieving grief as you see them crushed like a mosquito. Blood and then silence. It's not entirely right to say \"nobody is safe\" as plot-immortality applies to certain characters and that is quite evident. Although the anime is going to make you doubt yourself.\n\nGone are the anime physics where someone can go flying into a wall and can get up without a scratch. If someone flies into a wall in this anime, that's it. Game over, man. Game over. This is no anime for children; it is a complete bloodbath. It is not afraid to show you crushed limbs, torn-away faces, stinking, steaming bones, people's necks being snapped like chickens. It doesn't shy away from letting you hear screams of people facing their last moment on earth.\n\nBut it's not the violence alone that will sock you hard ones to the stomach -- it's the story itself. The concepts behind what is presented and also actual events will have you reeling. The second arc of this anime more or less will have you screaming \"NO, IT CAN'T BE\". Because you simply don't want to believe what you're seeing or who it involves. The entire series will have you holding your head wondering what is going on. The characters themselves don't really know, and you share that confusion with them. Shingeki no Kyojin's story is by far one of the most creative and well-crafted in modern anime history. It has the right tone, focus and content. It develops surprisingly at every turn. This is an anime you cannot necessarily lay out a trajectory for in terms of what is going to happen. You take every episode like it is tomorrow -- you ultimately cannot know what can or will happen.\n\nVisually, it boasts some finely animated fight scenes, especially when the soldiers use their gear to go \"flying\" through the city. This gear is pretty inventive and can be likened to Spider-Man's web-slinging. The soldiers train to be agile and precise using this gear as it catapults them through the air. The best users of this know how to manoeuvre throughout a city block, across a titan's back or across the sky as though it were their first nature. The animation makes sure to keep you on your toes during action scenes, angling shots to keep momentum or knowing just how close to do a close-up for the best effect. The dark lines and general colourlessness of the art style keeps with the tone of the overall series. However, you can see where budgetary shortcuts were had, and while nothing to deter from the series, it is not quite perfect. Music-wise, the sound builds on the horror and the dramatic tension, and while some tracks are certainly recognisable as you watch on, they aren't entirely memorable.\n\nShingeki no Kyojin is all about experiencing it. You can have time later to think about what's happening or to theorise, but there is no time for that in the midst of watching. There are only held breaths, churning stomachs, wide eyes and feelings of absolute horror. There are times when humanity seems to be getting somewhere, where you think, okay, there's a chance now. Hope. It exists somewhere, as small as it might be, hidden in the depths of crushing losses and corpses and city rubble. It's there, and that's what Eren and his friends will give their lives to find.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by tehnominator (\n9\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

One that lives with you.\nIt is no wonder that the film has such a high rating, it is quite literally breathtaking. What can I say that hasn't said before? Not much, it's the story, the acting, the premise, but most of all, this movie is about how it makes you feel. Sometimes you watch a film, and can't remember it days later, this film loves with you, once you've seen it, you don't forget.\nThe ultimate story of friendship, of hope, and of life, and overcoming adversity.\nI understand why so many class this as the best film of all time, it isn't mine, but I get it. If you haven't seen it, or haven't seen it for some time, you need to watch it, it's amazing. 10/10.\nSleepin_Dragon\nFeb 16, 2021\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nDon't Rent Shawshank.\nI'm trying to save you money; this is the last film title that you should consider borrowing. Renting Shawshank will cost you five bucks... just plunk down the $25 and own the title. You'll wind up going back to this gem time and time again. This is one of few movies that are truly timeless. And it's entertaining and moving, no matter how many times you view it.\nForget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in \"The Shawshank Redemption;\" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today. \nSome liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar. \nHow ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"Citizen Kane.\" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time. \nAnyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. \nBut every aspect of Shawshank fit together. The acting from the top to the bit part. The musical score. The editing. The photography. The story, from opening credits to final scene. All involved, including the town of Mansfield, Ohio (where Shawshank was actually filmed) played their roles perfectly. Shawshank is a must- see, must- own title.\nEyeDunno\nNov 20, 2005\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nA classic piece of unforgettable film-making.\nSpoiler\nkaspen12\nFeb 9, 2006\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nThis is How Movies Should Be Made\nThis movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.\nOther than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd \"Red\" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been \"institutionalized\". \nThe directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance. \nWhatever you do, don't listen to the people who say this movie is overrated because this is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies ever. It has everything you could possibly want.\nalexkolokotronis\nFeb 17, 2008\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nShawshank Redeems Hollywood\nCan Hollywood, usually creating things for entertainment purposes only, create art? To create something of this nature, a director must approach it in a most meticulous manner, due to the delicacy of the process. Such a daunting task requires an extremely capable artist with an undeniable managerial capacity and an acutely developed awareness of each element of art in their films, the most prominent; music, visuals, script, and acting. These elements, each equally important, must succeed independently, yet still form a harmonious union, because this mixture determines the fate of the artist's opus. Though already well known amongst his colleagues for his notable skills at writing and directing, Frank Darabont emerges with his feature film directorial debut, The Shawshank Redemption. Proving himself already a master of the craft, Darabont managed to create one of the most recognizable independent releases in the history of Hollywood. The Shawshank Redemption defines a genre, defies the odds, compels the emotions, and brings an era of artistically influential films back to Hollywood.\nThe story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy's demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle.\nBy creating the film's firm foundation, the meticulously chiseled screenplay paved the way for this film's success. Frank Darabont outdoes himself with the phenomenal adaptation of Stephen King's equally noteworthy novella, Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. In this novella, King demonstrates that he can break free from the genre he dominates and still create a marvelous piece of modern literature. Though the film mirrors the novella in many ways, Darabont illustrates a focused objective of improving upon the areas where the novella came up short, resulting in one of the best book to film transitions ever.\nWhile maintaining some of the poetic and moving dialogue of the novella, Darabont also proves that a film's score can generate a great deal of emotional response from its audience, as dialogue does. He employs the cunning Thomas Newman, son of the legendary Hollywood composer, Alfred Newman. Darabont shows recognition for the film's needs by employing Newman, who makes the gentle piano chords whisper softly to the viewer, as if a part of the scripted dialogue. Newman lends himself to individualism and tends to drive more towards the unique in the realm of score composition. His effort in Shawshank did not go unnoticed, as his score received an Oscar nomination in 1995. While unique and independent, Newman's score never once intrudes on your concentration or distracts from the film.\nWith work from vast array of talented scene designers, costume designers, composers, cinematographers, and various other Hollywood artists, the cast of The Shawshank Redemption had a strong foundation to work with. The marvelous cast of this film will dazzle you with some of the most convincing performances you will witness in a film. While both Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman shine as Andy and Red, respectively, the true spectacle of acting lies within the plethora of amazing supporting actors who easily disappear into their roles. Most noticeable of these, the veteran film star James Whitmore, who portrays the elderly Brooks Hatlen. Brooks, a man incarcerated for an unmentioned crime for so long that he finds himself attached to the Shawshank and the daily life he has lead. Each of these actors show a true dedication to their art, and a focused purpose in their motivations, creating a convincing setting that never once caters to anything unbelievable.\nWith all of the aesthetic touches and attention to cinematic detail, the most beautiful part of the film lies within its thematic material, such as its focus on the human desires for the most abstract concepts, like hope and freedom. These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date. Like a great novel, this film manages to succeed at greater things than simply entertaining an audience. Darabont tells his story most masterfully, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. He leaves us a poignant film with a powerful message of hope, and redemption, something we all seek.\nThis film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget.\nweswalker\nAug 26, 2002\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nthe shawshank redemption\nThe best movie in history and the best ending in any entertainment business\nauuwws\nOct 7, 2020\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nEternal Hope\nI've lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, but it is more than 20. It has to be one of the best movies ever made. It made me take notice Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins like I had never noticed any actors before.\nI have from a very young age been a huge fan of anything Stephen King writes and had already read the short story that this movie is based on years prior to seeing this movie.\nNot everything Stephen King has written that gets turned into a movie comes out well, but this is as close to perfection as it gets and has everything you could ever want in a movie.\nSomething that is outstanding is the fact that it has no real action, no special effects and no gimmicks. 99% of the movie is just men in a prison uniforms talking. Yet it absolutely hooks you almost from the beginning and has you glued to the screen to the end.\nFor me what really makes this film one of the best is the message of eternal hope it conveys throughout. The never ever give up hope attitude of the main character so well conveyed by Tim Robbins. The ending is just spine tingling every time I see it, no matter how many times I have seen it.\nBrilliant, brilliant movie and a must see for everyone.\nnowego\nJun 14, 2018\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nIMDb and the Greatest Film of All Time\nTwo imprisoned men (Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman) bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency.\nIs this the greatest film of all time? IMDb would have you believe so. Despite being a box office flop (that barely recouped its budget), the film received multiple award nominations and outstanding reviews from critics for its acting, story, and realism. It has since been successful on cable television, VHS, DVD, and Blu-ray.\nAnd it deserves this praise that seems to be growing each year. Now twenty years old, the film has not aged a day, and instead seems to be getting better. This is Tim Robbins' best role, and a fine performance from the always wonderful Morgan Freeman.\ngavin6942\nNov 5, 2014\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nThe Shawshank Redemption\nOne of the finest films made in recent years. It's a poignant story about hope. Hope gets me. That's what makes a film like this more than a movie. It tells a lesson about life. Those are the films people talk about 50 or even 100 years from you. It's also a story for freedom. Freedom from isolation, from rule, from bigotry and hate. Freeman and Robbins are majestic in their performances. Each learns from the other. Their relationship is strong and you feel that from the first moment they make contact with one another. There is also a wonderful performance from legend James Whitmore as Brooks.\nHe shines when it is his time to go back into the world, only to find that the world grew up so fast he never even got a chance to blink. Stephen King's story is brought to the screen with great elegance and excitement. It is an extraordinary motion that people \"will\" be talking about in 50 or 100 years.\nCoxer99\nMar 24, 1999\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nStephen King's best adapted movie\nMisery and Stand By Me were the best adaptations up until this one, now you can add Shawshank to that list.\nThis is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.\nKing is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully. \nWhat makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again.\nI'm not going to say any more about this film, it has already been said, but just suffice to say that I am glad that Forrest Gump won best picture in 94. I would have been equally glad if Pulp Fiction or Shawshank would have won. It is that good of a movie and one that will be appreciated for years to come.\nbaumer\nJul 12, 1999\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nEnthralling, fantastic, intriguing, truly remarkable!\nSpoiler\nTheLittleSongbird\nApr 16, 2009\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nSimply known as \"The Movie\"\nWhenever I talk about this movie with my friends, I do not even refer to it by title, but rather as \"The Movie\". When I say \"The Movie\", my friends know exactly what I'm talking about. In fact the main reason that me and my friends don't refer to it by title is because this movie is so great, that we do not feel worthy enough to say it's name in vain! I still remember the first time I saw The Shawshank Redemption. Some friends of mine and I went to see it at one of those \"Budget Theaters\" over the summer of 1995. None of us really knew anything about the movie, but we had heard that it was pretty good. So, not having any real expectations, we saw it. When the final credits rolled and the lights came on in the theater, all of us just sat there with our jaws hanging down on the floor. I turned my head towards my friend Bob and said \"That was the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life!\" There's really no other way I can put it in words. Every moment of this movie captivated me and inspired me to believe in the one true thing in life...... \"HOPE\". This movie is sad, uplifting, inspiring, harsh, cold, funny (at the right times), jaw-dropping, and heart-warming all at the same time. I get chills every time I watch this film and this film contains the greatest ending (which takes place over the last 30 minutes or so)in movie history! How it all just \"comes together\" is so incredible and uplifting. I should also mention the music in this movie is nearly flawless as well, and the soundtrack is a \"must buy\" for any music fan. The only bad thing about this movie is the fact that I know I will never see a better movie, no matter how many I may see. I've seen many movies over the past few years, many excellent films. However, every time I walk out of the theater, I turn to my friend or family member that I saw it with and I say, \"That was a great movie, but it wasn't nearly as good as 'you know what'!\" There have been many movies over the past few years that thought would really move me or that I might one day call my \"favorite of all time\", but they've all fallen far short of \"The Shawshank Redemption\". So, if you have yet to see this movie, please run to the video store immediately. You're guaranteed to find it in the \"employee picks\" section. And if it isn't in that section, then you should tell the employees there that there is something seriously wrong with them. If you have seen this movie, go see it again. If you haven't bought your own copy yet, buy one. In fact buy two, and put one in a fire-proof safe, just in case of an emergency. :o) So, you want a 1-10 rating??? I give it a 13!!!!!!\nschnad\nFeb 5, 1999\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nThe absolute GREATEST movie of all time.\nSpoiler\nKORN-6\nOct 20, 1998\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nSimply amazing.

This movie is just absolutely stunning in so many ways. Acting perfect, storyline perfect, soundtrack perfect, emotional drama perfect, everything about this movie is perfect.\nWhen this movie first came out it did not reach the expectations that many people expected it to. But as the years went one it was nominated for seven Academy Awards and as it was available for rent everywhere more people started appreciating it and it's popularity grew. Eventually after many years in the top 5 of IMDb's top 250 movies of all time list, it hit number 1 with over one million votes.\nThe story is about a well educated vice president of a large bank being wrongly accused of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to spend life at a large prison in new England called Shawshank prison. As the years go on in his new home he makes friends, enemys and a dramatic twist at the end which became one of the most legendary scenes in movie history.\nI love this movie. The acting is just so passionate and their performances increases the drama and horror of life in prison. The soundtrack is one of the main reason behind the emotional drama this movie. Many scenes in this movie almost left me in tears mainly because of the soundtrack in the background which increases the emotion. \nThe cast of this movie include Academy Awards winners Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins. And also William Sadler, Bob Gunton and many other who made this movie what it is.\nOverall it is defiantly the Greatest movie ever made with passionate acting, great storyline and plenty of emotional drama about how hope overcomes fear in a beautifully crafted film about the strength of the human spirit.\njosephledbury\nJul 15, 2013\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nMasterpiece\nThis for me and many other people is the greatest movie of all time it has amazing directing it has amazing acting by Tim Robinson and Morgan freeman whoever says that they don't like this movie should never watch another movie again overall the greatest movie of all time.\nsaimaq-27868\nOct 1, 2021\nPermalink\n10\n/\n10\nFrom my favorite movies..\nIt is one of the best movies in the world that many people will join me.

He always professes his innocence, but is thrown into Shawshank Prison with other lifers like Red (Morgan Freeman).\nDirector Frank Darabont has made a prison fable out of a Stephen King short story. It is well acted by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman. Freeman is especially important as he is the narrator and the POV of the story. It's his lyrical voice that makes this fable compelling. It could have easily been a simple prison movie that rang hollow. Freeman gave the readings depth.\nIf there is one complaint, it is Andy's claim of innocence. It needs to be shown early on during the trial. Instead, we derived mostly from Andy's demeanor. It needs to be a big declaration at the beginning. When Tommy (Gil Bellows) tells the story, he should include one detail from the trial like the 8 bullets. That way, the audience can get an aha moment. It's a minor point, and overall this is a good prison fable.\nSnoopyStyle\nDec 7, 2013\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nIf other people would rave about it less, I'd rave about it more\nThe redeeming feature of this film is that it was made in innocence. Darabont had no idea he was making anything profound. And he wasn't. This is a film about a prisoner who ... well, I can't give away the plot, for it's much better to come to the screen in ignorance; but anyone who thinks that this is a story about how Andy `finds out the truth about himself', or is in any way `redeemed', is grasping at straws. These elements play so little role in the overall structure that we might as well ignore them.\nI have a theory: so many people have told Darabont that `The Shawshank Redemption' was a profound life-changing experience that he believed them, and then SET OUT to make another `profound, life changing experience' with `The Green Mile', with predictably ghastly results. I haven't seen `The Green Mile' yet, so I can't be sure.\nDon't get me wrong. A great movie needn't be profound, and the film which I think is the best ever made isn't profound, either - it contains no comment at all on the Nature of Human Existence or anything of that kind. Still, `The Shawshank Redemption' isn't even great. It's a very good story very well told. Lucky we get such nice photography, rather than having to put up with Stephen King's prose every step of the way ... Also, Tim Robbins has the lead role. (Lucky, again, that it wasn't Tom Hanks - now THERE'S a frightening thought.) Nobody can do the bewildered but intelligent innocent so well as he can. Fans make such extravagant claims about this movie, but I don't think it makes such extravagant claims about itself, which is why it works so well.\nSpleen\nMar 6, 2000\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nExcellent Movie, But Not \"Greatest of All Time.\"\nSpoiler\njbartelone\nFeb 16, 2008\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nEmotionally Fulfilling\nSpoiler\ngcd70\nFeb 18, 2008\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nMeh?

Hope can set you free. A strong man can save himself. A great man can save another.\nt-14356\nMay 28, 2020\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nObservations...\nAlmost as interesting as this tale of men behind bars is the enduring popularity it has enjoyed since being released on video following its poor box office. The reason is fairly clear to see: for all its dark setting, the film is about hope and how hope can set you free. We all have hope, and we all feel imprisoned – whether it's by a dead-end job, a loveless relationship, an out-of-shape body – and it's only the hope that things will somehow improve (even if, unlike Andy Dufresne, we do precious little to help things along) that keeps us going. The Shawshank Redemption validates this blind, irrational hope while simultaneously reinforcing it. This is the film's strength, and it uses it to good advantage. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman make believable if unlikely friends – at the beginning of their friendship one lacks hope of any kind while the other is unable to express his feelings, a flaw he later realises is indirectly the reason he finds himself behind bars. By the end of the film both have changed – and both are released.\nThe film makes use of every genre cliché you can think of: the sadistic guard, the corrupt warden – fifty years ago, Hollywood wardens were mostly beneficial characters, but they seem to have lost their way lately – the bull queers, the fish out of water with no chance of survival, etc, and although this isn't necessarily a weakness, it's familiarity means the overlong running time drags on occasion as we're faced with all too familiar situations. And while there are malevolent prisoners present in the form of the bull queers who wander around looking for 'fresh fish' and vulnerable inmates to rape, all other prisoners are a kind of homogeneous mass, a decent enough bunch with few unique characteristics and no malice or resentment towards a society that has effectively discarded them.\nThe irony of the film is that the good guys are the ones behind bars – as Dufresne wryly comments, he had to come to prison to become a criminal – while those ostensibly representing justice and law are violent braggarts and bible-bashing hypocrites. Their come-uppance, when it finally arrives, is wholly deserved, and there are few films that engineer a turning of the tables as wholly complete as the one engineered here by Dufresne – another reason for its phenomenal popularity: we all know, or have known, someone like the warden (although perhaps not as extreme), smug and self-serving, who deserves their come-uppance.\nDarabont wanted the film to end with Red giving his little 'I hope' bit while the bus he's travelling on disappears over the horizon, and it's a shame the studio didn't let him have his way. That ending on the beach looks exactly like what it is – a tacked on ending to keep the men in suits happy. Andy Dufresne, with his uncompromising sense of purpose, would surely have held firm under their pressure\nJoeytheBrit\nSep 15, 2010\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nBreaking Big Rocks Into Little Rocks\nThis Film has a Strange History. Nominated for Seven Oscars (winning none) the Movie was not a Box-Office Hit and Faded pretty much into Obscurity as an Arty Film with two Lead Actors Delivering Standard Good Work, but Nothing to get Excited about.\nBut Something Happened that is Really Unexplainable. People got Excited about it. No one seems to know Why or What Manifested said Excitement, it just Happened. A Resurrection to become one of the most Beloved Movies Ever. Managing to Steadily Climb to \"God-Like\" Status among Best of Lists and Fanatic Praise.\nIt is a Fine Movie. A Throwback Movie. A more or less Standard Storytelling of Human Perseverance and Hope against Outrageous Misfortune. A Feel Good Film that has made a lot of People Feel Good. Nothing Really Out of the Ordinary Happens as far as Prison Dramas go. But what does Happen is done with such Subtlety and Pathos that the Long Sentence of the Running Time goes by Effortlessly. \nThis is a Great Movie that Never tries to be Great. it's just a Smooth, Entertaining, and Effective Personal Prison Drama with some Social Messaging and Character Explorations. The Usual Prison Sledgehammer Approach gives way to a Rock Hammer. Small and Light, but it gets the Job Done.\nLeonLouisRicci\nMar 15, 2014\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nA great film, but #2?\nA great film and one that I shall be adding to my collection at some point, but #2?\nOne user put it very well when they said that the film's essential message of 'the human spirit conquering all' is very uplifting an' everything but sounds too much like a fortune cookie homily.\nThere are several films that deliver the same message just as well if not better. Jim Sheridan's \"In the Name of the Father\" springs immediately to mind. That film has a similar theme to this one (wrongful imprisonment and the struggle to come to terms with it) but is a much better film IMO. What's even more heartening is that it's also true.\nLike I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great. From what I can remember all the performances are nicely judged (Freeman is excellent, but then what's new?), the direction is perfect because it's so unobtrusive to the story, and the film in general is uplifting. I just think it's nothing particularly new and it has been done better. Maybe my viewpoint is borne out by the fact that it only became a huge success on video release?\nI gave it an 8. To me, this fact proves that I love the film, just not as much as everybody else seems to!\nI think this adaptation is on a par with the short story, which was also excellent. I honestly can't agree with #2 on the top 250 list though. Is it just an American over-reaction to the movie or is every other nation as awestruck by it? Please feel free to e-mail me for discussion on this, or anything else for that matter.\n#2 of 250? I don't think it would make it into my top 50 films.\nAh well, life's all about opinions...\nHowlin Wolf\nMar 7, 2001\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nOverrated\nThis film is overrated, it can't possibly be the best film ever, there are much better films than that, however it is still a good film.\nMinsseeoo\nDec 23, 2020\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nProbably Not #1\nWhilst the IMDb users may disagree, the Shawshank Redemption isn't my number 1, maybe not even my top 100. But with that said, I have seen this movie a few hundred times and it gets wary. There is no doubt it is good, I may even say it's close to great and it has a pretty good watchability rating, but it's forced metaphors get on my nerves now and, in reality, is just another prison movie which is above average. \nBoring if you have seen it a few times, but for a first impression it is good. Once you start to analyze its elements you can begin to see the film for what it is. A perfect film it is not, but the acting is near perfect and the realism is somewhat accurate. Not my favorite film, not my favorite prison film, but give it a whirl and see how you decide.\nmichaelradny\nJul 28, 2015\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nA cinematic phenomenon\nWhat can I possibly add to a review corpus of over 1.2 million ratings and three thousand reviews? This movie has been called \"one of the best movies of all time\", \"a powerful story about friendship, hope and freedom\" and a \"latter-day retelling of the Gospel story\". Many people have seen this movie multiple times, and some claim it has changed their lives and even saved their lives.\nAt this point, I'm rather more interested in the phenomenon than the movie. My take on it: this movie appeals enormously to ordinary people (especially American men) who feel trapped by difficult situations in their lives. Some may be looking to be rescued, like Red was; others may take comfort in the thought that their long-term pain, tedium and oppression will someday result in a spectacular liberating event. This movie satisfyingly scratches that annoying itch called \"life is unfair\".\nIt's difficult to know what to think about all this. Whatever you think about the phenomenon, \"Shawshank Redemption\" is also just a good movie with excellent writing, black and white characters, a simple but satisfying plot with a few surprising scenes, great acting, and a certain amount of tear jerking. It's not a movie to be missed.\nLaakbaar\nJul 31, 2014\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nMy favorite movie was The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.\nMy favorite movie was really The Godfather until I saw The Shawshank Redemption.\nA lot of people would might disagree with, but I love this movie. the actors are great, the director has done a fantastic job and the screenplay is magnificent.\nI was so impressed with how every single subplot was given a great deal of respect and attention from the director. The acting was world-class. I have never seen Tim Robbins act as well since, Morgan Freeman maybe (e.g. Seven). The twists were unexpected, an although this film had a familiar feel, it wasn't even slightly pretentious or clichéd, it was original. The cinematography was grand and expressive. It gave a real impression of the sheer magnitude of this daunting prison.\nI remember, when i saw the movie I didn't want to get up and go to the toilet. When I finally was done in the bathroom, I couldn't wait to get back and press play on my DVD. At the time I was done with the movie I wanted to see the movie again.\nThis film manages to redeem Hollywood in the eyes of people who feared it long lost in a dark sea of clichés and predictability. Darabont shows us that artists still work in the Hollywood studios and production facilities. These artists show their capability to produce art; real art that inspires you to look at the deeper aspects of life and the world around you. The Shawshank Redemption delivers much-needed breath of fresh air for anyone who realizes the capability of film. It proves that masters of the craft still live on this earth, and still bless us with timeless masterpieces that we will never forget. \nSo see it, buy it, love it.\nstetho\nMar 12, 2006\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nOverrated and overthought\nSpoiler\nsigurd-vilstrup\nJun 12, 2014\nPermalink\n8\n/\n10\nA Feel good Movie: Greatest ever?

Nah.\nSpoiler\nclipturnity\nAug 21, 2010\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nMindcraft...\nThere are those who seek to dive into your mind, take your secrets and whatever else they find, espionage, conspiracy, infiltration, skulduggery, through worlds that are all conjured, well designed. They've been asked to plant a seed, start an idea, change the course of an industrialists career, but it needs dreams within deep dreams, an architect to build the schemes, and the consequences, could be quite severe.\nImaginative beyond words, elegantly crafted and constructed, presented and performed by legends of the screen with a great storyline that keeps the viewer constantly engaged and on the edge of their seat - what more do you want out of movies.\nXstal\nMar 30, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nIntellectual masterpiece\nInception is a beautiful piece of film that has impacted a large part of the film industry. With everything from the actors to the cinematography to the music, this movie without any elaboration perfected almost everything there is.\nInceptions slow start is the only weak point of this movie. It begins intensely to then slows down for the next 20 - 30 minutes. While then finishing off as an impeccable film. Nevertheless, this is what brings the film down for me.\nThe director Christopher Nolan managed to create a masterpiece with little to no mistakes. At no point during this intensely long movie did I feel bored. Instead, I was always excited and on my toes intrigued.\nThe acting in this movie was phenomenal. A small number of great actors that all had their character arc while also doing incredible performances. It is truly beyond me how Dicaprio didn't win an Oscar for his performance.\nMeanwhile, also employing the greatest composer in history with Hans Zimmer, the music adds significantly. The music adds an extreme amount of excitement and keeps you constantly interested. Few composers can make you notice the music, but Zimmer succeeds per usual.\nTo finish of the film was astonishingly shot. With beautiful eye-catching scenes. While also containing some incredible action scenes that might be some of the best action I've seen. With a thought-provoking storyline that finishes of with an unbelievable ending.\nI highly recommend Inception to everyone and I promise you won't be disappointed.\nakdjreview\nNov 22, 2021\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nThis is your first lesson in shared dreaming. Stay calm.\nSpoiler\nhitchcockthelegend\nApr 6, 2011\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nA Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Buñuel meets Kubrick in Nolan's most ambitious venture, till date\nSurrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. \nThe movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. \nLeonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.\nInception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.\nPS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/\nmurtaza_mma\nJul 25, 2010\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nMore than just an aMAZEing movie\nOnly a small handful of directors have the ability to make an audience wait on pins and needles for their next NON sequel release. For me, i cannot remember the last time i was this excited for a movie i know virtually nothing about. Now i know i may be speaking on my own here, but director Christopher Nolan very well may be the best director of our generation. Because the guy has not missed so far. \"Memento\", \"The Prestige\", The Batman Series......the guy is a loose cannon who fires nothing but cinematic gold. As time goes on, he only seems to get better and better. Hopefully he can continue the re-occurring trend.\nOkay, let me get this off my chest, because it feels like an alien ready to burst out of my chest........this is easily one of the 10 best movies i have ever seen in my entire life. And that is not because i built this up in my mind or bought into the hype generated around this film, because everything i thought this movie was going to be, fell short of what it actually was about 20 minutes into it. This movie is cinematic genius at it's best, plain and simple. We have been due for a movie like this for a loooonnngggg time. And i don't mean this year, or the recent string of poor movies that have been released......i mean we are due for a movie that actually changes the way we look at movies. Now i know one would be quick to say \"Well wait a minute, Avatar already did that.\". But that is where you would be wrong. James Cameron gave us a feast with \"Avatar\". This movie cooks you an entire Thanksgiving dinner.\nI could honestly sit here and try as hard as i could to try and describe the movie to you, and it wouldn't make a lick of sense because the movie is beyond in-depth. Case in point.....you remember the first time you saw the first \"Matrix\", and how complex and deep the plot was. Well, in words, this movie makes that idea look like \"Kindergarden Cop\". No disrespect to \"The Matrix\" at all, but this movie is probably the most in-depth, detailed, complex, and entertaining movie ever created by man.\nAnd that's all Nolan seems to do. He creates these scripts that almost take a life of their own. You get a glimpse of it in \"Memento\", and you certainly see it in action with \"The Prestige\"......how the actual plot outline and story, is the actual trick. In this movie, it deals with mazes, and in turn, the whole movie is like a giant maze that you try and figure out.\nBut that's where Nolan's true genius comes in. Through out the entire picture, he gives you these little clues as to whats going on, like a puzzle, and he shows you how they all get put together, rather than putting it together for you. He leaves it up to the audience to do so. And that's what makes this movie great, because he challenges the audience like no other movie i have ever seen.\nAnd speaking of things i have never seen. In order for a movie written this well to work, it must be shot in the same fashion. And Nolan, once again, out does himself. If you are a fan of cinematography, as i am as well, then this movie, literally, is your wet dream. Talking about these elaborate dream sequences is one thing, but seeing them in action is beyond anything you have ever seen on the silver screen. Throughout the entire film, i kept taking a napkin to my face to wipe the clumps of drool that were collecting at the bottom of my jaw.\nBottom Line, this is a movie i could write a novel about, and it certainly deserves that attention. To pretty much sum it up, if you want to see the movie that is going to win best picture of the year, go and see this movie. If you want to see one of the best movies in the past 10 years, go and see this movie. If you want to see a movie that will pretty much change your method of thinking, then go and see this movie. God only knows how many movies i have seen in my lifetime, but i can say with complete just, that this is certainly one of the 10 best i have EVER seen.\nblackmambamark\nJul 12, 2010\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nRequires Concentration\nAn incredibly unique film which deserves its plaudits purely for the intelligent world created. Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.\nVisually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.\ndeepfrieddodo\nJan 31, 2021\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nIncredible movie\nThis movies is a masterpiece by one of he greatest directors Christopher Nolan.

I especially liked DiCaprio, Tom Hardy , Gordon Levitt.\ncasualobjection\nDec 18, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nWhat a GREAT Movie !!!\nSpoiler\nmoeedsheikh8-225-673296\nDec 29, 2016\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nDidactic, but nonetheless a good movie.\nInception has a problem that I cannot bear: the constant that someone comes to explain the laws and how that world works. The creation of the character of Ellen Page (Ariadne) was for the sole purpose of explaining that to moviegoers. Not that it's bad, but at certain moments it seems like the movie becomes more class at school, to know how that universe works, instead of the characters in this movie live the adventure for themselves. In this aspect the film is didactic. And the space for the imagination is limited. In this aspect everything in this film is chewed, everything explained, where are the possibilities? I do not want someone to explain the universe, I want to see the characters live and react in this universe.\nYes the ending leaves open the question whether that is a dream or reality, but it is a cheap gimmick instead of letting them our imaginations fly. If at the end of the movie the experience of the characters was a dream, so it was waste of two and a half hour, at least the Matrix shows the characters in the real world, and that it was not a dream inside a dream. The tension and time invested would not be a waste of time \nNot that it spoils the experience of the film, but it disturbs in some parts, mainly in the middle of the film, when the group is preparing for the assault. The concept is good, but it should be presented in a simpler way. Clearly Nolan was very ambitious in the concept of this film. But Nolan is quite integral in the proposal of his films, and he tries to put unknown concepts to the general public in such a cohesive way, even with the problem of trying to explain everything and other problems of pace are easily forgiven. Nolan tries to do his best in each of his films as if his movie was his last, as if his life depends on it. A great honesty on the part of Nolan, and this I can and I want to enjoy. Nolan is such an honest guy and scores points with me. It's the difference between the lousy movie director and an excellent director. The bad elements of Inception are not enough to spoil its qualities. The ambitious ideas of the filmmaker and the great sequences in parallel assembly that characterize his works. \nNot that the idea of Inception is innovative, this idea has been copied many times in other works (Paprika, Synecdoche New York and The Matrix are the most practical and common examples). But it's the way Nolan puts these ideas in the big budget blockbuster. Let's be honest here. Smaller or lower budget films are not seen by the general public due to the absence of of large production values (a great soundtrack, great locations for filming or great special effects, etc). See these ideas or concepts in a great Hollywood blockbuster made with such quality and care, it is amazing. And these ideas are embedded in the drama of the film in such a cohesive and exemplary way; it is applauding Nolan's professional integrity. This is why Nolan movies are so well received, he tries to put in these Hollywood blockbusters something more, something common in indie or smaller films, but with the financial aspect of the great studios to provide a better technical quality.\nObviously there is quality on this movie; the large parallel sequences are exemplary. The parallel between the Van sequences, the hotel with the Joseph Gordon-Levitt (when character is awake in the elevator), the peak at the military base in the snow and the desolate city of Cobb and Mal is almost perfectly made with an all- encompassing soundtrack. Of course the sequences of action are lousy . And many dialogues are very weak. Two weaknesses in Nolan's movies.Bad things come with the good things. I suspect that the bad action scenes of Inception and Dark Knight were the reason why Nolan turned DKR into an action movie instead of trying to tell a good story, Nolan's ego should have been hurt by the criticism as he directs his action scenes in these two films. Particularly Inception and the action sequence in the snow with Tom Hardy. Too bad, sorry.\nBut the performances are amazing, particularly Marion Cotillard as Mal. There are many layers in the various characters which Nolan conducts with mastery and the way they are inserted into the film is almost perfectly. Particularly in the initial sequence (which I thought would be a scene to showcase special effects, and Nolan proved me wrong). Or in the scene between Ariadne and Cobb, when Cobb tries to explain how his wife dies, and then discovered new layers of the character to reveal that in fact, he did have to do with the death of his wife. Of course this will be important to the outcome of the film. It is this ability to put the scenes and the flashbacks in certain key moments of the plot that Nolan shows much quality, and one of his long lists of virtues. \nInception is a movie like any movie; it has its flaws, but also its virtues. But, for me the qualities overlap the defects, and in the end the movie is well worth watching. But is its legendary statute being worthy? If Inception was released in the 1980's would it have the same impact in that decade, as it had in 2010? Currently the commercial movies in Hollywood are in crisis. We live in an era of remakes, superhero movies and franchise fatigue without the studios or directors making an effort to improve with originality or at least with a little more original concepts. Inception's credit could be lower if today's Hollywood was not in such a decadent state. But nonetheless, Inception is still a good movie.\nDanielpotato\nDec 29, 2016\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nThe ultimate high concept movie!!\nI've watched this movie because it has a great rating and because I love Christopher Nolan and in my opinion it totally deserves this great rating...it could maybe even be a little bit better...\nThere are tones of great stuff in this movie like the concept of dreaming which the whole movie is about and this is one of the greatest concepts I've ever witnessed.

Everything in this movie is perfect as per my requirements. There is enough mystery, action, drama, sci-fi and effects. The plot is perfect and Nolan did great in the development of that fantastic idea. I could not want nothing more from the script and the realization of it. As it comes to the cinematography Nolan was exceptional in what he have done in this movie. The final is a bit different and unexpected but perfectly made and all of the people who watch the film will be asking themselves the question: \"What happened?\". \nThe actor's play is great too, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are awesome in their roles. It's not strange that Nolan is working with some of the supporting actors in more than one of his movies. Despite the most attention went to Di Caprio and Gordon- Levitt the others should not be passed. Ellen Page, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Caine did great too. I want also to mention Tom Hardy. I didn't know him before Inception, but he is one of the actor who won my attention and I enjoy his acts in other movies too. \nAs it comes to the soundtrack, I think that just mentioning the name of the Hans Zimmer should be enough for the movie fans. According to me Zimmer is the best in the business. Once I checked his biography I was more than impressed with the fact that he made soundtracks for more movies than I could though. The most impressive part is that he did it for great ones, not just for some mediocre films. The soundtrack of Inception is one of the little that I listened after watching the movie.\nAccording to me it is quite normal that Inception won Oscars for cinematography, visual effects and sound, but still it is very strange that the academy awards for best movie, best actor and best writing were not given to Nolan's masterpiece. I really think that Inception is far better in every aspect than King's speech and I know that this topic is widely discussed but Di Caprio was great and deserved the award more than Collin Firth.\nAs a conclusion I will definitely suggest to everyone who didn't watched Iception to do it as far as he could, because he missed on the greatest movies ever. \nI gave 9/10 because 10/10 is waiting for the movie that is still not done.\nrusi-nikolov\nFeb 9, 2015\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nThis decade's Matrix - Sheer Awesomeness\nSpoiler\njulianx8\nJul 14, 2010\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nChristopher Nolan has outdone himself yet again...\nI walked into the theater knowing relatively nothing about this film, and I walked out...knowing even less. From the moment it begins to the moment it ends, you will be wondering what is going on. These initial questions are simply because those trailers we've been watching all year have hardly prepared us for what is about to happen. Most of us just buy a ticket on our faith in either Christopher Nolan or Leonardo DiCaprio. (In my case: both.) As the movie progresses, your questions grow deeper, more layered, just as the dreams you are viewing excavate the furthest reaches of the unconscious. It's an absolute ride, and in IMAX, it's astounding.\nIt's easy to see how this is the product of Nolan's work in Memento. It deals with the same issues of our narrator's reliability and questions of reality. Both main characters have a tragic self-awareness that seems like a plus in the beginning of the movie, but by the end, you'll wonder if what they trusted to be true and what you trusted to be true is even true at all. Like the dreams themselves, the plot lines and characters begin to fall apart, but our Architect, Christopher Nolan, is the one pulling the strings. This is a film that moves beyond its medium and pulls you in. I'd almost say it breaks the fourth wall without even trying to.\nIt goes without saying that the special effects are one of the highlights of Inception. This will probably be The Matrix of our time, but in a much subtler way. As Dom says, \"It's only when you wake up that you realize there was something strange.\" This strangeness is embraced and pulled throughout the film. However, the mazes, infinite staircases, and alternate realities these special effects create are not limited to just providing an aesthetic wonder, but they serve to symbolically reinforce many of the main issues of the film. The paradox of an infinite staircase will be itching your brain for a few hours after you finish watching.\nThe performances are pitch perfect. I initially thought that the characters were a bit one- dimensional and not incredibly developed. Don't be alarmed though. Nolan hasn't lost the touch that created his Batman and his Joker. I believe there are deliberate reasons for this lack of background, which will surely feed into the theorists that will begin sprouting all over the internet after this weekend. Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard provide the emotional and narrative center of the film. Being the Oscar winning and nominated actors they are, these roles are played beautifully. It's as if they don't even realize they're the ones we're all focused on. \nI would've given this a 10/10 if it weren't for the excessive use of Hans Zimmer's music. I'm a major fan of Zimmer's work, but I believe music in a film is instrumental when trying to give your audience some sort of cathartic release. At the moment I needed that from the score, it had already been playing non-stop for an hour, so it really made no difference in my emotional response. That's my only complaint, but I'm a film score nerd so don't worry about it.\nI'll end this now before I start confusing myself even more. It's a privilege, though, to see an auteur like Christopher Nolan working today, using the summer blockbuster as his medium. You'll leave the theater feeling as if you just \"witnessed\" something.\nstreetcar1951\nJul 15, 2010\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nYou May Never Sleep Again\nSpoiler\nRichardSRussell-1\nJul 15, 2010\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nMasterpiece\nThis movie has everything.

Many are saying that they want to see it twice in order to grasp everything, but one viewing is enough if comprehension is all you want to get out of the second viewing. This being said, I would love to see this movie a second time. The acting is outstanding and the chemistry between the actors makes the movie so pleasant to watch. You instantly forget that these are actors. The chemistry between Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon Levitt is phenomenal. Also, Leonardo is unbelievable as always, and no one can look better in a suit.

Did earth manage to conquer what the Krells could not?\nChristopher Nolan wrote and directed Inception and though it gets a bit heavy at times, it still is an unmistakable masterpiece. Leonardo DiCaprio stars in this and he's essentially a cat burglar of the mind. His mission usually is to invade people's dreams and steal ideas which makes him an invaluable espionage agent. But Leo's also a wanted man.\nSome problems Leo has relating to his Id have forced him to rely on others to create dream worlds. He was working against Japanese billionaire industrialist Ken Watanabe and got caught, but then Watanabe likes his style and hires Leo and his team to do a job on the young heir to a communications conglomerate, Cillian Murphy. It's not to steal anything, but to plant an idea in his brain with the dream team. The film is essentially how DiCaprio and his crew go about this job with Watanabe incidentally along for the ride. And its how Leo has to deal with some real demons involving guilt that force him to rely on others.\nVery nice computer graphic generated special effects characterize Inception and it will probably earn an Oscar nomination next year in that category. Director Nolan gets his talented cast to read writer Nolan's dialog with verve and conviction. \nI truly hope this technology is not in our near future that would be a frightening thought.\nbkoganbing\nJul 20, 2010\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nAn HONEST review\nInception is a resplendent cinematic experience that had me hooked from the opening scene till the very end. As a viewer, I was enthralled by its intricate plot. The characters in Inception are deeply nuanced and expertly portrayed by a remarkable ensemble cast. The chemistry between the cast members is palpable.\nVisually, Inception is a feast for the eyes. Inception demands your full attention to grasp its intricacies; it requires active engagement and a willingness to navigate its twists and turns. Some may find its complexity overwhelming.\nInception is a cinematic marvel that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Does it qualify as what is known as a \"masterpiece?\" Yes. However, SOMETHING, just something, held me back from a 10/10 rating. I'm not quite sure what, but there's just something small missing to get it to that perfect rating.\nIn conclusion, would I watch it a second time? Yes. Would I recommend you to watch it for the first time? Yes.\nnmalik-99759\nMay 28, 2023\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nClassic movie by Nolan\nSpecific and unique plot. Excellent cast and soundtracks. Interesting special effects.Nolan knows how to create a tense atmosphere in films.Something was missing in the movie...\nzurdulla\nJan 5, 2020\nPermalink\n9\n/\n10\nWARNING : Nolan is putting an idea inside your mind !!!\nWhen I first saw the early 2009 trailer of this movie I was intrigued because I knew this time Nolan will not repeat himself in a brilliant breathtaking action movies like he made before in his new Batman or the deep thriller he represented in \"The Prestige\" or the mind-blowing \"Memento\"\nNo, This time Nolan will make his crown jewelry his own masterpiece.\nThis time Nolan will teach us how to make a thriller-action-psycho-mind blowing with intelligent science tricks movie .\nAnd when I saw \"INCEPTION\" yesterday I wasn't disappointed. In the first few minutes you will be bolted in your chair trying to get the grasp of what is going on around you. I can only describe it as the same reaction when you first saw \"The Matrix\". There is certain rules going on you can't understand, which will begin to reveal its meanings after a while.\nCobb \"Dicaprio\" is a strange character-reminds you of \"Teddy Daniels\" at his last \" Shutter Island\"-his job is stealing the ideas from the industries' pioneers by tricking them in their dream state to reveal their secrets.\nThis is the main character the film is all about, around him a clever cast of Joseph Gordon- Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken watanabe, Dileep Rao and Michael caine to support him in his new \"mission impossible-like\" job.\nThe job is instead of stealing an idea is to put a new one in the mind of a rich industry heir \"Cillian Murphy\" by putting him in a deep three level dream in order to reach to the core of his mind to plant this idea.\nDuring the film you will discover the danger they put themselves into by doing so, and that Cobb \"Dicaprio\" is hiding a secrets of his own. Also a several shift between different dreams happening in the same time away from what is happening in reality with a time perspective change which was a surreal experience. \nA twist of brilliant camera,visual,action & science tricks is the main theme of this movie, you can't trust any of your senses, you can't make the difference between dreams and reality, you are caught up in-between all the time. I can't describe it really only by that you don't know if you took the blue pill or the red one as like in \"The Matrix\", and maybe it is much worse because during the movie you won't know whether you are dreaming or watching a movie in a cinema - or maybe its just me - :)\nThe final words that Nolan has answered the question of why the cinema won't die, by showing us that there is still a huge creative space waiting to be discovered.\nmom_ash\nJul 16, 2010\nPermalink\n25 more\nAll\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

I saw \"Inception\" last night. I had high expectations based on miles of positive ink from reviewers and professional critics, all tripping over themselves to bestow demigod status upon Christopher Nolan. These expectations were dashed to bits within the first thirty minutes of the film, and turned to a kind of dread as I realized what folks these days will accept as \"depth\" in their entertainment. I wish I'd never seen those gushing reviews, I would've enjoyed the film much more. \nNow, don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan's Batman reboots \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight.\" For my money, those were without a doubt the second and third most effective superhero movies to date (sorry, Raimi wins.) The man certainly knows how to keep a story moving along, and he knows how to film action. In the case of The Dark Knight, Heath Ledger provided an emotional lynchpin non-pareil in his Joker portrait, and Nolan milked it for all it was worth. There was real pathos and genuine mortal horror built into the foundation of the film's impressive structure. Also, the fact that it was based on a comic book lowered the bar and allowed the audience to suspend just enough disbelief to allow most of the dorky plot elements to slip through and do their work. \nNow let's discuss obvious comparisons to an earlier effort in this vein—that is, an action movie dolled up to the nines as philosophical treatise. I'll admit that I was never a fan of The Matrix. I thought it was asinine in conception and brutish in execution, even as I admired some of the visual effects and spectacular stunt work. Comparing The Matrix's ridiculous endless \"stream-of-consciousness\" gibberish about free will with, say, Roy Batty's laconic final soliloquy in Blade Runner, is like comparing the Twilight series' moronic teen romantic angst with David Foster Wallace. Unfortunately, Inception had precisely the same effect on me, which is to say very little. \nHere we find the great and terrible Nolan exploring the tired territory already plundered in countless films of yore, including Hitchcock's Spellbound and 1980's genre pics such as Brain Storm, The Dead Zone, and Dreamscape. The basic premise reads like a dime store sci-fi novel's back cover: \"In the future, we can enter into each other's dreams! Feel the magic of dreams, within dreams, within dreams! Experience the thrill and wonder of miraculous \"Dream Time.\" Oh Boy!\" Within twenty minutes of the film's somewhat intriguing intro, I knew not only how it would end—I also pretty much knew how we were getting there. Nolan plays primarily to the back row, and—no offense, America—but we've been slightly dumbed down over the past few decades, and we're much easier as a whole to entertain than we used to be. Look back at a few films of the past with vast, labyrinthine plot structures like Hawk and Faulkner's \"The Big Sleep\", or practically anything by the Coen Brothers. What's defines their deep-impact gravitas, as opposed to the flat and diffuse emotional landscape of Inception? It's character development, pure and simple. In this case, Nolan didn't have a single character —especially the one played with typically earnest gusto by Leo Dicaprio—with a plausibly human fatal flaw, foible, or reason for doing uh, whatever it was he was doing. We're simply dropped into an alternate universe with rules seemingly invented to favor nerds of any stripe —almost impossibly similar to the one in The Matrix—and told to hold onto our hats, because here we go! Except we're not actually GOING anywhere, or at least not anywhere we haven't been a thousand times before. \nSorry to rain on the parade of everyone that's ready to lionize C. Nolan as the great white hope of modern blockbuster cinema, but from my vantage, there is no there there. If you want a lesson in basic existential philosophy, take a class at your local community college. You'll get more out of it, and you can keep your textbook as a souvenir. If it's great car chases you're after, rent \"The French Connection,\" or \"Ronin.\" In other words, keep your high-octane action movie out of my high-concept art film. These are two tastes that do not go great together. Meanwhile, if Inception somehow does \"become a religion\" in another five years, than I'm reconsidering my continued faith in Hollywood as some kind of egalitarian oracle, where the huddled masses can go to get their myths, and feel the true power of redemption. If this is the kind of movie that will be worshipped from now on, than the god of blockbuster cinema may truly be dead.\ndjdksf\nJul 25, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nGimmicks For Sale\nBrilliant technical wizardry. Heady, at least apparently so. A ride more than a movie but a movie none the less. Chris Nolan is rapidly becoming the director of his generation and I'm longing to find out what is he trying to say. He has established his technical power again and again but if I think of \"Memento\" for instance I remember the gimmick but not what the story was really about. I suspect the same will be said of \"Inception\". I'm not putting down, I'm just wondering. I left the theater full of questions and nobody could actually give me any answers. I'm not talking about the plot but at the way Christopher Nolan chose to tell the story. Leonardo Di Caprio is acquiring some extra gravitas as an adult presence on the screen.Loved Cillian Murphy, I always do. Riveted by Tom Hardy. Enchanted by Marion Cotillard. Amused by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and delighted by Ellen Page. I wonder what Mr Nolan will do for an encore.\ndaniel-ire\nJul 18, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nChristopher Nolan continues his climb to the top... of the most overrated directors list\nIf there was ever a film to label as \"overrated\", it would be The Dark Knight. If there was ever another film to label as \"overrated\", it would be Inception. I just don't understand what it is about Christopher Nolan's films but they have the tendency to receive large amounts of unwarranted and undeserved praise.\nWhile they are very well-made films, they are for the most part nothing more than entertaining popcorn flicks (Memento being the one exception). Popcorn flicks of the up-most quality but nothing truly memorable or deep. Now that I have gotten that out of the way, lets get on with the review.\nNow, basically, Inception is a heist film with a twist. The heists take place inside of a dream, thus allowing for some creative and tricky special effects to be pulled off. These effects are pretty amusing to watch, most notably a scene where the gravity of a hallway is shifting and the two actors are duking it out amidst the gravity shifts, and this makes for some impressive-looking chaos.\nThe story while somewhat original, wasn't pulled off as smoothly as it could have been in my opinion. There were just far too many plot holes that you could drive a tank through. Now with a certain proper ending, these plot holes would diminish, but Nolan has yet to confirm just what the ending means so the plot holes are left intact. If you want a better idea of what I mean by that, PM me.\nActing for the most part is good and gets the job done. Just don't expect anything Oscar-caliber here. If there was one stand-out performance in Inception, I would definitely say it's from Leo Dicaprio. The guy proves time and time again that he's one of the better young actors working right now. The rest of the cast gives passable performances, but nothing special. Michael Caine is wasted, and I feel the only reason he was hired was to get his name on the box.\nNot much needs to be said about the special effects. They're some of the best yet, and at times even creative. Possibly the strongest aspect of the film, next to the effects, is the musical score. Inception has one of the best scores in recent memory. My hat is off to Hans Zimmer. The effects, score, and flawed but intriguing story come together in making Inception a very enjoyable and entertaining film. It's definitely smarter than your average popcorn flick, but at the end of the day it's still just a popcorn flick. Nothing more, nothing less. It lacks the emotional punch and attention to detail that made District 9 so great (now that's a true masterpiece, and one of the greatest sci fi films ever made).\nI give Inception 7.5/10 and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun film that will also make them think a little bit.\nhot_action_ninja\nDec 7, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nOver long, Pretentious twaddle\nThis is not a bad film per se, had it been about 30-40 minutes shorter I would not have been too offended. But I'm genuienly perplexed as to how people can rave over it-#13 on all time list at time of writing!! There is virtually no character devlopment the plot overly complicated and riddled with holes and contradictions. Frankly you don't need to suspend disbelief so much has have it surgically removed and flushed down the toilet. By the end I was wishing I was in a dream within a dream policed by a completely arbitrary set of nonsence rules - any thing to get me out of that chair.\naltamishsiddiquee\nMay 11, 2020\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nGood but over long and not that clever\nSpoiler\ndbborroughs\nSep 17, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nNot A Dream\nI went into this movie expecting one of the best movies of all time. However, that is not what I saw. The runtime is extremely long and I found myself checking the time several times throughout the film. It was an interesting film to see, but it definitely does not belong on a list with the likes of \"Shawshank\" or \"Godfather\". The story was very confusing.There seemed to be plot holes and loose story lines that were never really tied up. The concept of the film is very intriguing and you will leave the theater wondering what it was all about. However, the atmosphere of some of the scenes felt very similar to Shutter Island for me. I almost felt like Leonardo DiCaprio did not really have to act much as he was basically playing a character similar to that of Teddy Daniels. Hope he isn't going to spend the rest of his career playing that same character. It was also nice to see Ellen Page in something besides Juno. She can be more than a snarky, pregnant teenager. Also, The visual effects are extremely well-done.\nI am not a fan of Nolan's work. The Dark Knight was a film that I could never understand why there was so much hype. It was average to me, at best. Inception, however, is much better than Memento.\nIt is a film that you must see just because the concept is very interesting, but it is not something that you can watch over and over again.\nkayteecee\nJul 31, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nDesperately loved by stupid people who want to appear smart...\nThere is no doubt that Nolan is a very talented director, and I like a lot of his films, but sadly I think like a number of other hugely successful directors before him (Peter Jackson springs to mind) his success has led to a detrimental degree of freedom for him to churn out his own poorly-written scripts unchecked, and make films that are about an hour longer than they need to be. \nI know I'm swimming against the tide of public opinion here, but while I was hugely excited about seeing Inception back when it came out, I was absolutely crushed on first viewing. I found it terribly written (the film begins with enough exposition scenes to fill a normal film's running time!), incomprehensible (editing was all over the place, action dull and repetitive), visually disappointing (all the best bits were revealed in the trailer and were all contained in the exposition scenes rather than having anything to do with the story) and with a concept that just didn't hold water (the dream sequences seemed to always resemble Matrix out-takes and were held together by a logic that just wasn't very dream-like)!\nPerhaps if Nolan had a studio breathing down his neck and someone to revise his shaky script this could have turned out well, but after the success of TDK he can effectively write his own ticket and is (sadly) free to churn out this kind of lazy and self-indulgent snooze-fest. The same thing happened with Peter Jackson after LOTR with King Kong (an hour too long, too much freedom etc.)\nHans Zimmer's incredible score was about the only positive I took out of Inception (Zimmer's brilliant scores are increasingly the glue that holds Nolan's films together and makes them seem better than they are). Despite his obvious talents and love of film (I love him for shooting Batman stuff in IMAX 70mm!) Nolan has some very bad habits (mainly relying on his and his brother's writing) which I think really hamper his films these days. I loved TDK, but it frustrates me in almost equal measure, and though I haven't seen The Dark Knight Rises yet, I will go in with very low expectations based on his apparently dwindling form.\nSnowgoat\nJul 25, 2012\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nThe Movie Hater strikes again\nInception is the first movie nominated for Best Picture that I hated on. It's not all that.\nMy biggest problem was that they couldn't get me to care about the relationship between Leonardo DiCaprio, his wife and his child, which was suppose to be Dom Cobb(DiCaprio character) biggest motivation. I could care less for any of the characters, I wasn't emotionally invested at all.\nThis isn't the first time Christopher Nolan tried to take Film Art concepts and commercialize it. This is an attempt at making a surrealism commercial. The problem with trying to make a surreal movie for the general public is that you have to make it understandable to the masses. The dreams in the movie was too orderly. Surrealist films like, Un Chien Andalou, are chaotic like dreams.\nBig visuals and action sequences aren't enough anymore, if you can't get me care about what drives the story, you're going to lose me.\nmaloned\nMar 28, 2011\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\n9/10, really? Must be some sort of flocking behavior\nSpoiler\neatpajdittsvin\nJan 30, 2011\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nThis Film Is Great, But Only In Some People's Dreams\nWell, I didn't think it lived up to all the hype, but nonetheless it was still a pretty good film. I don't think the story came out quite the way Nolan had hoped, after working on it for over a decade. In my view the story is basically a combination of Vanilla Sky meets The Matrix, but really it ends up being less meaningful than both (A combination of the mystical waking dream and the matrix of consciousness). This is Nolan's version of Edgar Allan Poe's A Dream Within A Dream, or the like. However I don't think the film really comes across this way as well as it should, or especially, the way it was meant to.\nTake this kiss upon the brow! And, in parting from you now, Thus much let me avow- You are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; Yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, In a vision, or in none, Is it therefore the less gone? All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream.\nI stand amid the roar Of a surf-tormented shore, And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand- How few! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep, While I weep- while I weep! O God! Can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp? O God! Can I not save One from the pitiless wave? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream? \nThe film overall feels forced and clunky, it lacks any kind of good rhythm. For me to see this film ranked in the top 15 films ever made according to the IMDb voters only goes to prove one thing; The IMDb top 250 list is good for nothing at all but a laugh. \nI thought Inception was pretty good. However pretty good is stretching it as far as I would ever go. This film is a long long way from great.\n7/10\nTheAnimalMother\nJan 18, 2013\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nNot even close to the acid trip the movie trailer was hinting\nSpoiler\noskars666\nOct 31, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nInteresting but overrated\nI was keen to see this film given the high IMDb rating, as I agree with nearly all ratings I've seen on the site, but I appear to be one of the minority who think it is overrated. I couldn't emotionally engage with the characters for some reason, and so was not too concerned on the outcome for them.\nWhilst there were some complexities to the plot, it is reasonably easy to understand. I agree with some other comments I've seen that many characters accepted the quite fantastical premise very readily, and were prepared to place themselves at considerable risk for no real reason. So some reactions were not what you would expect for the situation.\nHaving had time to reflect I would watch the film again, but do not think I will keep coming back to this unlike the Matrix which has a similar feel but is a much better film.\nGHarlow-897-186408\nJan 11, 2011\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nGood, but overrated\nLike all Nolan's films, it's mind-bending and original, and incredibly entertaining. But, sorry, they're not as brilliant as people think. There's always so many holes in the writing, as mentioned by others, like how Matthew McConaughey went inside a black hole to communicate with his daughter on Earth in Interstellar. Is it creative? Sure. But for those of us who like our writing to be tidy, it's more than a little annoying. Furthermore, it has no real twists or intrigue.\nFor a person who is deeply interested and well read in psychology, I enjoyed the journey into the psyche through dreams. It's accurate in many ways that a dreamer does not control their subconscious, and theoretically, one could hijack it. In fact, people do this all the time, but one does not need to be asleep and dreaming. It's called brainwashing. No dream within dreams within dreams necessary.\nI liked the levels of action - it is a fun watch. And all the actors are adept in their roles. I really don't even mind when writing is not based in reality, as long as people realize that it's not. There's really nothing particularly bad about Inception - it just doesn't live up to the hype.\nsherylchilders82\nMay 20, 2024\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nEntertaining, well done, but....not what some hype it to be.\nSpoiler\nAlmaCuerpocaliente\nSep 11, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nA good film, but not as good as the hype\nI heard a number of great things about Inception, including from my sister who came out saying it was one of the cleverest and best movies she'd seen. After seeing it for myself, I thought it was a good film, but not as good as I was led to believe. Out of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen, Inception didn't wow me as much as Memento and The Prestige, and it is one of my least favourites of his so far. Does that mean the film is bad? No, I am just saying I do not think it is Nolan's best as I have heard people say.\nMy main problem with Inception was the lack of emotional attachment, I do understand completely anybody who says it is emotionally cold. Particularly in the characters, they are written and acted well, but not much is done to make us empathise with them and their predicaments. I loved the idea of the story, it was clever and somewhat original and it did start very compelling and intriguing, but as the film progresses it does become rather convoluted and I found myself losing a little interest. Also, the pace is uneven, as the characters became more cold and the story more convoluted, the film really does start to drag until the conclusion where the film does thankfully pick up.\nInception despite these faults does have a number of strengths, especially the beautifully crafted production values, dream sequences and effects and Nolan's superb direction. Hans Zimmer's score is incredibly good too, while powerful and haunting it rarely becomes overbearing, while the dialogue is on the whole clever and thought-provoking. The acting is generally very good, both Leonardo DiCaprio, with a more hardened persona which has grown even more, and Ellen Page give strong performances and while Marion Cotillard is underused she is pretty good as well and Cillian Murphy I think gives the best supporting performance as he is superb.\nOverall, Inception is a generally good film but not as good as it is lauded to be. 7/10 Bethany Cox\nTheLittleSongbird\nMar 4, 2011\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nWhat About It?\nThis film is overrated. Besides being accompanied by a score determined to set you to sleep there's really no filmmaking here that sets it above the rest.\nThe plot is very interesting and, for the most part, well conceived. However, the characters do too much talking simply explaining to the audience what the meaning of their actions are. Why assume the audience is inept?\nThe basis of the plot itself is where film most earns its grade. This is truly a unique idea for the screen. Unfortunately, it was denigrated by the unnecessary dumbing down of the story and the unimpressive acting of the cast.\nNo matter what the subject of a movie, to end it with the question of whether it was all a dream or not is not clever.\nyoungbonzi\nAug 14, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nMeh, 7 out of 10. It was OK, not revolutionary\nI must be, like, getting old and jaded or something. I found the movie predictable and more straightforward than I hoped it would be.\nA good alternative name for the film would have been \"Wait, what?\" as if there was any less action you'd be constantly asking yourself why the eff they didn't do X, or why Y didn't happen etc. The word \"contrived\" will keep nudging at your brain if you're not doing an exceptional job of suspending all disbelief along with all common sense.\nThe final scene of the film was rather obvious from early on I thought.\nI found it relatively easy to follow, exactly what I was expecting, and totally lacking in interesting \"Sixth Sense\" plot twists. Everything pretty much was as it was presented to be.\nNot sure how this makes it to #3 on the all-time best list.\nThe Matrix was way more entertaining...\nG.\ngavin-42\nAug 18, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nGreat movie, and concept.\nI really liked this movie, it is long but keeps you intrigued and interested. What I didn't like and made me want to stop watching it is the score, there is way too much of it, too overwhelming that the characters don't have any personality, all emotions are driven by the score and the orchestral backdrop really. This is present in most Hollywood movies, which is unfortunate.\nkarimnn\nFeb 28, 2021\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nStrikingly original masterpiece? No, but it is intriguing.\nNow I will start by saying that for all the many flaws and silly plot holes, which seem more glaring the more you think about them after viewing the film, I did enjoy the ride. It didn't really stick closely to it's own rules and some of the characters got lost in the shuffle - well, most of them, I suppose - but at least Nolan was trying to create something more than the same old flicks Hollywood churns out like the hot-buttered popcorn you can buy at every cinema. It's not terribly original and nor should anyone buy into the hype that it is, but that doesn't mean it is without merit.\nTo dispel the myth that this is original, I have to say it draws fairly obvious comparisons to the following works, which isn't to say it lacks originality, more that it treads the same sort of path with a different flavour.\n* The Matrix (1999) - Anyone who doesn't see this must be blind; they seem to come from the same seam. It's one of the few similar films that can stand up next to it though. * Dark City (1998) - The buildings, the gravity. I can't say more than that. * Blade Runner (1982) - Chris loves this film. It's more in visual styles than story but it's there. And when I think of the title I can't help but think of the term \"incept date\". * Star Trek TNG - For the holodeck reference/style mostly. * Heat (1995) - The action scenes, despite the fantasy settings, seem remarkably tight and often quite realistic. * Synecdoche, New York (2008) - The more I think about it, the more similar it seems to this film, and the more this film seems similar to Dark City. Which is why I like them, I guess. * Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (2004) - Love is a big theme and how the mind deals with it an even bigger one. It would spoil Leo's story arc to say more. * eXistenZ (1999) - Can't believe I nearly missed this one. In that film it is virtual reality, as with The Matrix, but there are still a lot of parallels. * Ocean's Eleven (2001) - The whole thing about it being a concerted team effort to pull of such an ambitious caper.\nThere are a lot of tiers at work here, and it's probably going to be the case that it's good first time around, and perhaps more intelligible after another viewing or three. Of course, the folks who fund Nolan films are aware of this and are hoping to double their revenue streams, actually adding this observation to some of the marketing bumph in the hope of getting people to go and see it twice a la Fight Club which makes me more than a little cynical, but I can wait for the home release anyway and would recommend everyone else do the same. This looks like a fun one to learn, certainly something worth studying if you happen to have more than a passing interest in film-making and convoluted slight-of-hand storytelling, and you really need to be able to pause, rewind and freeze-frame advance certain sections in order to do that.\nIt mines the seam of \"what is reality, really?\" a favourite topic of Andrew Niccols and Charlie Kaufman, too. Those are among my favourite types of works because they beg endless discussion and if handled correctly can be a great source of inspiration. As I have a soft spot for those kinds of plots I suppose I'm naturally more willing to grant a bit more leeway, because credit where it is due I did find myself mulling over my perceptions of reality and re-evaluating the value of lucid dreams. Most films leave no discernible traces in the minds of anyone which makes this at least above average.\nThe special effects aren't overused and/or intrusive, merely adding to the story I feel. And the mixture of CGI with real photographed elements is deftly handled. There is the odd moment of \"oh, too much\" or \"not layer blended so well there\" but trust me, it's far superior to a lot of the junk that gets through and at times I actually think they were deliberately making it a little weird and obvious to show it's still not a real world.\nTo tie this review up: as one of the seemingly few people who thought The Dark Knight was a hopeless mess with very little to enjoy outside of a fiery Heath Ledger performance it's a welcome return to the twisting story lines that are usually a Nolan trademark. Despite the length there is enough going on that it doesn't feel like a moment of filler is present. Also, I would like to briefly point out that this is the first film DiCaprio has starred in where I actually enjoyed his performance completely.\nThis film is not his best but nor is it his worst. It is well worth a watch, no doubt about that, but it shouldn't be heralded as a masterpiece and as of the time of writing this review is far, far too high in the IMDb Top 250. I'll grant that it is better than most of the cookie-cutter remake product that Hollywood is very fond of dishing up as of the past decade or so, therefore it looks better by comparison, but it isn't quite coherent enough to be brilliant. Hopefully it will inspire other writer/director auteurs to come up with similar, perhaps more lucid works. As it is, Memento (2000) and The Prestige (2006) are still the high watermarks against which few others can measure up, even the man himself. But it's still one hell of a ride.\ngarydiamond\nAug 28, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nNot living up to the hype...\nI went into the cinema to see this film with sky high expectations given the domestic and international reviews of it. Phrases like \"modern classic\" and \"landmark film\" made me think that I was in for something truly special in terms of film history along the lines of Citizen Kane and The Godfather.\nTurns out I wasn't, well not all the way anyway. I won't bother with the whole plot line, since it's very sprawling and complicated, but suffice it to say that my main disappointment with the film stems from the fact that the thematics of the story simply are too limited and ordinary compared to the potential impact of the film's gimmick: the fact that you can enter somebody's dream to steal information or plant ideas.\nThe plot revolves mainly around industrial espionage, a theme which simply does nothing for me emotionally. Who cares if one industrial tycoon wants to stop another? The dream concept of the film is truly magical and innovative and is a very compelling feature of the film itself. But why in heaven's name marry it to something as pointless as industrial espionage? What happened to something like the fight for world domination? It would have given the film infinitely more punch if the plot had centered around some political intrigue in stead. Especially given the unstable nature of the world today with wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, huge climate issues, and so forth.\nThe subplot involving Leonardo DiCaprio and Marion Cotillard's characters to me comes off very flat, their on screen chemistry not being very strong. This is a shame, for the premise of the subplot has great emotional potential.\nAll in all, somewhat of a disappointment, despite the wallop one inevitably receives from the film's take on the concept of entering someone else's dreams.\nPennyLANE77\nAug 13, 2010\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nMr. Nolan is like a cold mathematician\nWhere should I start? It would be better to get straight to the point. Firstly, despite the idea is brilliant, in other words, generally the story of the movie is brilliant, ideas don't make a movie great as just complicatedness doesn't make a movie good. By this movie, personally, I have understood that Nolan is not \"my director\". The Dark Knight was also a serious disappointment for me and Batman Begins was just a summer blockbuster (Following and Prestige were very very good) As for Inception, the biggest flaw of the movie is the movie is lack of heart and soul, in other words, it is cold. The characters are cold, the atmosphere is cold, the reactions are cold, because they are in dream? Well, I don't think so. It causes what then? I didn't much care about the intrigue, couldn't identify with the characters, so the most important problem of the movie is its dramatic structure. The second is the \"dreams\" itself. You know, the agent of dreams in cinema is David Lynch. Why? Because he shoots creative, intriguing, sometimes meaningless as it should be and surreal dream sequences. The dream sequences in Inception can only impress the architects, mathematicians and some businessmen (because there are a lot of men in black suit) It is because like his approach towards Batman, he sticks to reality. Despite the visual effects are jaw dropping, \"the street bending\" scene is my favorite, it doesn't help much. By the way, honestly, I couldn't understand the trick of Ariadne, for example, is it planned or impromptu? If the point is impressiveness, well I was much more impressed by Sucker Punch for example which has been exposed to harsh reviews. The movie also has not any dramatic twist, epic scene (except for a few moments) or real mystery which had been all necessary in my opinion. Can we say that the movie was low key? Thirdly, some, may be many action scenes seem pointless and ineffective. Especially the \"snow\" sequence. It was too long without real entertainment or excitement. There is not any problem with the cast (except the fact that in contrast with the majority, I think that Leonardo Di Caprio's performance in this movie was just good, not his best performance so far, it is nothing, for example in comparison with What's eating Gilbert Grape!), but it is a bit disappointing that Nolan often uses the same actors in his movies. A note: Michael Caine's character might be a tribute for his character in Children of Men. If you ask me, the best part of the movie is the \"train scene\" It was the only scene that I was dramatically involved and got excited. The \"gravity\" sequence was just interesting. I didn't find it epic. Finally, about the plot, I didn't find the starting point creative, brilliant or exciting. I mean the concept of choosing a businessman for inception, weren't there better options? In other words, the main story was too poor for the concept. However, if we consider Nolan's style, to tell a story about the world of business, might be exciting for him. However, if we consider the hype, the rating, the reviews etc. it seems that Mr. Nolan has deluded audiences again or we have been incepted.\nTheTheatreKidFrom90s\nAug 8, 2011\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nNot as good as I expected it to be after all the hype.\nThis is just an average big budget Hollywood movie.\nDon't expect any complexity or depth from it, it is simple and quite shallow.\nTechnically it's well done, the plot is OK, the actors are fine, the FX are good and hopefully you will have a good time watching the characters running and jumping around, ducking bullets and explosions and so on while a VERY SIMPLE AND QUITE SHALLOW psychological-scifi plot unfolds.\nBut you won't get much else from it.\nI'm giving it a 7. So folks, don't believe the hype about this thing being a fascinating and revolutionary piece of art, because IT'S NOT. It's just another Hollywood commodity out to make big bucks. If you want some enlightening psychology read \"?\" and don't watch this, for ***ck's sake.\nThere are some really cool effects to this film, but the story is so convoluted that it detracts away from the story.\nvampyrecowboy\nJan 4, 2011\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\na victim of the over hype machine\ni might be in the minority here but i was not blown away by this film.don't get me wrong.i enjoyed,ans it's well made,and has an interesting concept(the art of stealing a person's secrets from their subconscious while they are dreaming.but to me,it didn't(or couldn't) live up to the hype.it has its good point.it isn't boring and the acting is first rate,especially by Leonardo DiCaprio.i liked the look of the film too.many people i know have said it was so complex that they had to watch it more than once to understand it.i don't agree.i didn't find it complex at all.think it's well worth watching,but like i said,It just had too much hype to live up to.but that's just me opinion.for me,Inception is a 7/10\ndisdressed12\nMar 26, 2011\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nA good one\nThe acting performances are top-notch, with Leonardo DiCaprio leading the cast as the troubled protagonist, The supporting cast, including Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Elliot Page, and Tom Hardy, also shine in their respective roles.\nThe film's most impressive aspect is its intricate plot, which weaves together multiple layers of reality and dreams. Nolan's direction is masterful in keeping the audience engaged throughout the film's 2-hour-28-minute runtime. The special effects are also noteworthy, with the dreamscapes being brought to life in stunning detail.\nHowever, Inception is not without its flaws. The exposition-heavy dialogue and complex storyline can be overwhelming for some viewers, leading to confusion and frustration. Additionally, some of the action sequences can feel overly choreographed and lack emotional weight.\nOverall, Inception is a well-crafted and engaging film that is sure to captivate fans of science-fiction and action thrillers. While it may not be a perfect film, its impressive visuals, strong performances, and intricate plot make it a worthwhile watch for anyone looking for an immersive and thought-provoking cinematic experience.\nsyre-24208\nMay 4, 2023\nPermalink\n7\n/\n10\nTechnically Brilliant; Emotionally Empty\nChristopher Nolan is the 21st century's leading cinematic show-off. His 2010 movie Inception is a marvel of visual ingenuity and multi-tiered storytelling. Even as I watched this film for the first time, ten years after its creation, there was no denying he'd pulled off a very original, sumptuous film that sets a different standard for filmmaking in the new millennium. I was impressed. I was interested. But I was never really involved. Concerned that I may have been too obtuse to have taken in this film properly, I set out to learn a bit more about Nolan and Inception. From Wikipedia, I learned that \"Nolan's films are typically rooted in epistemological and metaphysical themes, exploring human morality, the construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and personal identity.\" Wow. If I hadn't dropped out of my first year philosophy course, I might have been better able to enjoy this film. At least I wouldn't have had to look up epistemological (\"having to do with the theory of knowledge,\" in case you were wondering). Okay, so I guess Inception may be all of those things, but as The New Yorker's David Denby points out in his review of the film, \"There's no spiritual meaning or social resonance to any of this\" (New Yorker July 26, 2010 issue). I couldn't have said it any better.\nIn case you haven't seen it already, Inception traces the story of Dominic Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio). He has a nifty job title: extractor. That means he craftily enters people's subconscious minds through a shared dream that his victims do not know is shared, and steals sensitive information to help the people who hire him become really rich and really powerful. Nice guy! Also, he is in exile. He sorely misses his young son and daughter, whose mirages we see many times throughout the movie, but only from behind, never glimpsing their faces. Poor Dom can not be reunited with his children in America because he is a wanted man there, accused of the murder of his wife Mal. Is the charge justified? This is one of the questions the film explores.\nIt's difficult to summarize the movie's labyrinthine plot in a review of this length. Suffice it to say, Dominic is sort of like Odysseus. He just wants to get home to his family but he is stalled in a dangerous voyage of his own undertaking, having to fight battles and outsmart unexpected adversaries in his latest victim's unconscious mind. Doing so will secure a safe passage to the U.S., provided as payment by his latest employer Saito (Ken Watanabe), a greedy Japanese energy tycoon. Instead of adventures on the high seas, Dominic's adventures take place in a multi-layered dreamworld. His mission this time is a little different. Instead of extracting information he must plant an idea in his wealthy target's mind. That's called \"inception.\" If successful, this will make his already super rich employer Saito become obscenely rich (what a great cause!). In order to build this maze-like dreamworld, making it safe and impervious to invasion from unwanted forces such as the lingering ghost of Mal (like in malware--get it?), he enlists the aid of a really smart young lady. In keeping with Nolan's habit of giving his female characters stupidly obvious names, he calls her Ariadne (Ellen Page), a reference to the mythical Greek daughter of King Minos who helped Theseus escape the maze of the man-eating Minotaur to whom he was sacrificed. I believe this is what we call \"intertextual\" storytelling. It's meant to enrich the meaning of the story by drawing in archetypal stories and themes to add depth. One would expect nothing less from Nolan, the grandiose showman of cinema. Well done Nolan! You are very smart.\nTHE ONE THING that disappoints the most about this film is that, even though the film transpires mostly in people's dreams, there is very little that is dreamlike about them. Instead, the dream landscapes are there to accommodate a handful of action movie setpieces. They are visually stunning setpieces to be sure. In particular, the gravity defying fight scene in a hotel corridor, in which people's bodies are pulled toward constantly shifting centers of gravity, to match a parallel tumble off a bridge in which the bodies of the sleeping dreamers within the dream are plummeting through space in a van. It is a remarkable achievement. However, it is not the stuff of dreams. Dreams are eery and psychologically unsettling. They express buried fears and longings while hinting at the existence of awe-inspiring supernatural forces. And quite often, the locations are spare and minimal. Great filmmakers like Federico Fellini and David Lynch filmed dream sequences that left viewers with gooseflesh, and they did so by fiddling with combinations of settings and sounds usually in spare surroundings. They did so by tugging at the viewer's empathic sense of kinship with the character, and sparking a commingled sense of attraction and dread to the dream narrative. Films can only achieve this effect of heightened emotion and involvement when there is something at stake, something that the viewer cares about. Regrettably, I didn't care about anybody or any outcome in Inception. Will one multinational corporation surpass the other in wealth? Who cares? Will the morally shady Dominic be reunited with his kids? I don't care that much because he's an emotionally closed character. Will Christopher Nolan tie up all the loose ends in his high tech mental thriller? I suppose he did but, again, I didn't care.\nInception reminds me of another film in which the main character yearns to return home, The Wizard of Oz. But unlike that film, it is all brains and no heart. Nolan needs to find the courage to admit he is wanting as a complete filmmaker and change his game to reflect the maxim that I learned when I entered teacher's college: \"No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care.\"\nesposip\nAug 27, 2020\nPermalink\n25 more\nAll\n\nMore from this title\n\nMore to explore\nRecently viewed\nYou have no recently viewed pages\n\nGet the IMDb app\nSign in for more access\nSign in for more access\nFollow IMDb on social\nGet the IMDb app\nFor Android and iOS\nHelp\nSite Index\nIMDbPro\nBox Office Mojo\nLicense IMDb Data\nPress Room\nAdvertising\nJobs\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nYour Ads Privacy Choices\n© 1990-\n2025\n by IMDb.com, Inc.\nBack to top",

The similarities between the two series are superficial at best, and though I can see why people would draw the comparison, I don't really think that dis/liking one means that you'll dis/like the other. But anyway, unlike Death Note, I wouldn't say that the story in Code Geass is particularly notable or unique. It's actually rather straightforward\n\n...\n\nand even a little cliche, but that's exactly why this is such a well done series -- the barebones storyline is handled in a refreshing and new way that grabs the viewer's attention. There are enough twists and turns involved to keep you on the edge of your seat. The pacing is excellent and nothing feels rushed or drawn out. Indeed, the progression up to the conclusion is especially brilliant. (It's a cliffhanger &quot;ending,&quot; but oh, it's just a fantastic cliffhanger.)\n\nThe series is also appealing in its uncanny ability to mix genres. Yes, this is a mecha series, but it really doesn't have to be. Yes, CLAMP did the character designs and there are some very shoujo elements (read: homolust), but there are very shounen rivalries and some pretty epic battle scenes too. Everybody wins! Additionally, because of the number of characters, the story allows for a number of small subplots. I was very happy with how this was handled in particular because all of the subplots relate and affect the main plot directly, whether by revealing some bit of information to both the characters and the viewer or by pushing forward interesting character development. Everything is well thought out and wonderfully executed, so despite the fact that &quot;strong-willed person with plans to change the world receives mysterious power that helps facilitate his goals&quot; isn't a very unique storyline... Code Geass makes it work.\n\nAlso. Code Geass utilizes the &quot;best friends trying to kill each other&quot; plotline, and I'm a sucker for that plotline.\n\nCHARACTER - The characters in this series are rather varied. Some are very plain and one-dimensional, while others have an amazing complexity to them that makes them very life-like. I'll be honest. I've become somewhat infatuated with Lelouch as a character (and am rather biased as a result). To me, he is very much a human character -- he has emotions, opinions, a unique point of view, and some very serious flaws, all of which make him incredibly easy to relate to and to sympathize with. He is easily the most complex character in the series, and he feels real to me, even with his supernatural powers and his genius-level intellect. This ability to make the audience relate to him is also probably the series' greatest strength and the main reason why the story is able to remain relevant and interesting despite the fact that there aren't too many new ideas plotwise.\n\nSuzaku would probably be second in line for complexity after Lelouch, though his sense of justice might be called cliche at first (along with Nunnally's and Euphemia's), and his hax-level physical prowess is somehow harder to accept than Lelouch's genius-level intelligence. It's harder to appreciate Suzaku's depth at first, partially because he is presented as Lelouch's main obstacle and the audience's sympathies are with Lelouch, but a great deal is revealed about his character throughout the course of the series, and he becomes an amazing foil to his rival. Their conflicting ideologies and philosophies are fascinating if you really look into it, and gay as it sounds, they really do compliment each other very well.\n\nMuch of the rest of the cast seems to fall into typical archetypes -- there's your adorable little sister, your mad scientist and his assistant, your cheerful schoolgirls, your best friend, your most loyal soldier, your second-in-command, your village idiot, your... really creepy lesbian girl? Despite the generic-sounding descriptions, most of the characters are actually pretty fun, or at the very least, interesting. C.C. provides snarky commentary. Shirley spreads innocent schoolgirl love. Nunnally is so moe you'll die. Jeremiah is a good butt of all jokes. Little bits of backstory are tossed in here and there to separate them from the crowd, but it's never enough to actually intrude, and the wide range of characters lets you settle into the world pretty well too; after all, what universe is complete without an animal mascot that shows up now and again?\n\nARTWORK &amp; ANIMATION - I wasn't too impressed with CLAMP's character designs at first (noodleboys!), but as always seems to be the case, they gradually grew on me, and I remembered just how pretty X was. CLAMP just knows how to make everyone look amazingly sexy, male or female. I really loved how they did all of the facial expressions in the series though, especially for Lelouch. Seriously, that guy had some of the most awesome crazy expressions, some of the most amazingly touching sadface expressions, and of course, some of the most amusing WTF expressions. The mecha designs for the Knightmare Frames were also pretty awesome. I dig the whole rollar blade thing, and some of the technologies they come up with are neat, if a little over-the-top. The animation is fluid and smooth for the most part and very few things stood out as being bad.\n\nMUSIC - Initially, I wasn't particularly fond of any of the OP/EDs for Code Geass except the first ending by ALI PROJECT because 1) they're awesome, and 2) Yuki Kajiura's style seemed to suit the series very well. The screaming violins both convey the high status of Britannia and the intensity of the emotions in the series. The rest of the themes seemed lackluster in comparison, but though I was never a huge fan of FLOW, &quot;COLORS&quot; kind of grew on me after a while. The final insert song, &quot;Innocent Days&quot; by Hitomi is pretty nice as well. Very thoughtful, very poignant, very fitting. The background music during the series was negligible for the most part; there is some pretty generic battle build-up type music and other appropriate, but rather typical, themes. Still, there's some neat classical/opera stuff, and the &quot;All hail Brittania!&quot; theme is definitely awesome.\n\nVOICE ACTING - I've seen all of Code Geass subbed and most of it dubbed. Although I was incredibly turned off by Johnny Yong Bosch's role as Lelouch initially, it kind of grew on me, and now I think it fits well enough, though I do wish he'd change his voice a little more when Lelouch is Zero (make it a little deeper?). Suzaku's dub voice surprised me with how appropriate it was too. One of the things I really wish we could replicate in English though, is the subtle differences in manners between characters, between Lelouch and Suzaku at various stages of their lives, and between Lelouch and Zero. In Japanese, when Lelouch and Suzaku are children, they refer to themselves with &quot;boku&quot; and &quot;ore&quot; respectively. As teenagers, the pronouns are swapped, with Lelouch using &quot;ore&quot; (Zero uses &quot;watashi&quot;) and Suzaku using &quot;boku.&quot; Euphemia uses &quot;watakushi.&quot; I'll skip the grammar lesson (go wiki &quot;Japanese pronouns&quot;), but suffice to say that these differences provide a lot of very interesting insight into each of the characters. It's really too bad English isn't nearly as interesting.\n\nThe rest of the voices in the dub are pretty average, perhaps the low end of average, with a stereotypically high-pitched girly voice for Nunnally that is amazingly annoying, and very forgettable voices for virtually all the female characters (Milly, Shirley, and Kallen all kind of sound the same). I was very impressed with Lloyd's dub voice though, even if nothing will ever amount to his amazing original voice, which is uh, amazing! Seriously. One of the most amusing voices I've ever heard. Jun Fukuyama's voice for Lelouch I found to be a bit too deep/old sounding initially, but that grew on me as well, and I really love the badassity of his voice for Zero. Suzaku's original voice sounds a little generic at first, but it grows with his character. There's a good bit of Engrish in the Japanese version as well, which is always fun. I don't think you can ever get tired of their &quot;Yes, my lord(o)!&quot; or their &quot;All hail Britannia!&quot;\n\nOverall, I'd say the original is damn awesome, and the dub is pretty watchable -- always a plus, right?\n\nOVERALL - I really love this series, and I definitely did not see that happening. Honestly, I found the first episode incredibly underwhelming: the opening sequence made it look like a series I wouldn't be interested in watching at all, and all of the expository really turned me off...but the second episode? That was so much more epic than I could have ever predicted, and I was pretty much won over after that. I'm just a sucker for chess analogies, I guess! Seriously though, good story, good characters, good animation, and good music! Mechas, politics, rivalry and comradery, strained friendships, love and hate, complex ideologies, and blowing shit up!

Why? It's filled with so much action, bombastic dialogue, and has such eye-catching visuals that it tops the charts in entertainment value. This is an exciting and epic anime and it's over the top. \n\nFor some people, the plot, characters, and music alone is bad enough to make the show unwatchable. For others, the high action, flashy animation, and drama will be more than enough to make the show a favorite of all time though I like everything about Code Geass. \n\nStory: Lelouch Lamperouge appears to be a typical high school student at Ashford Academy in the\n\n...\n\nBritannian controlled Area 11 (formerly named Japan.) But he's actually a prince in the Britannian imperial family, and seventeenth in line to the throne. He develops a hatred for the emperor of Britannia and the entire imperial establishment, vowing to one day destroy them for the death of his mother and cripple of his sister. After an encounter with a mysterious young woman named C.C., Lelouch gains the power of Geass, which grants him the ability to force anyone to do what he wishes. With this ability, Lelouch becomes a mysterious figure named Zero and begins his battle against the Britannian Empire. \n\nCode Geass have too many loose and cliff hanging ends. The end are always left unexplained, leaving the viewer with questions not only about various subplots but also about several key elements of the storyline. However, what makes up for this is the plot and character developments. Every episode is surprising and leave you eager to watch the next episode.\n\nIt seems Code Geass mainly focus on the drama, emotion, and the heart-breaking moments. Geass ends up being not so much a story with a certain plot and characters but rather a series of exciting, exaggerated but well-crafted, incredulous and definitely memorable scenes.\n\nCharacters: The characters, are so great and awesome that it's hard to stop enjoying them. There are characters that are a goody too shoe, outright intolerable that will make you want to strangle and kill them off the show. The characters are all so great that something unexpected might happen to them. There are also characters that are naive, filled with too much hate and/or love but in the end, you'll have a character you like or maybe even love. My favorite character, of course, are C.C., Kallen, and Lelouch.\n\nArt & Animation: Another good thing about Code Geass is its high production values and colorful animation. The character designs, created by CLAMP, are great and well drawn. The animation may not be great but it is detailed, vivid, and lively. The fights aren't as smooth or fluid as it could be but it's flashy, colorful, which is very much fitting considering the nature of the series. \n\nSound: The voice acting also plays a role in the show's success. Characters like Zero and Suzaku may be outrageous or cliched but their voice actors fit the characters so well that they are able to sell the characters. One of my favorite voice actor, Jun Fukuyama, does a great job playing the key character of Lelouch/Zero. His performance, especially how well he change from the carefree high school student to the more sinister and manipulative rebel is vital to keeping the series enjoyable and entertaining. Fukuyama is usually playing two characters and does it absolutely convincingly. There's nothing to complain about of the music either as the background music is very good and it fits right in it. The openings for Code Geass are my favorite. It's very paced and exciting.\n\nEnjoyment: I've seen Geass more than 5 times in a row already. (Not counting season 2) This is a nice, great anime. With the non-stop action, you'll be wanting to see which side will win and lose. For one moment you can be smiling, then crying the next. Happens to me sometimes.\n\nOverall: Code Geass is a awesome anime that will surely gather different opinions from viewers and other reviewers other than myself. I've seen and heard a lot of people saying SUNRISE has done an awesome job and it's not because of the use of mecha, action or drama, but rather how effectively it appeals to that certain aspect of anime that is not often addressed and yet is one of the main purposes of anime: entertainment. If your main interest in anime is in the quality of the storytelling or the characters, then Geass is probably not for you. However, if you're in it to have fun or for some good laughs, then take a look at this anime. You wont be disappointed. Indeed Geass is a rare accomplishment.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Plun (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 27, 2008\n\nIsambard\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Alright, its taken me since April to reach this point so I may as well dispense with any further delays and say it outright. Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is not a masterpiece, it isn’t a great show nor is it a very good one. What it is is a marginally good television program that takes concepts and characters from a wide variety of successful anime productions from the last decade and stitches them all together into twenty-five episodes of vulgarity and excess, a Frankenstein’s monster of a production that has the cold manufactured feel of a product of a focus\n\n...\n\ngroup rather than of a motivated team of creative individuals.\n\nLet me take a step back for a moment, because the truth of the matter is that Code Geass brought with it a genuinely compelling concept, one that could have done wonders if the creators at Sunrise had known what the hell they were doing. It takes place in an alternate universe where a version of the British Empire called Britannia, through various quirks of fate, manages to endure and thrive into the 21st century. After witnessing the assasination of his mother and having his and his sister’s lives ruined by his father, an exiled Britannian prince living under the assumed name Lelouch Lamperouge, out of a desire for revenge against the emperor, rises to become a revolutionary leader in an occupied Japan.\n\nThis concept could have gone in any number of directions and in the right hands could have been turned into something truly remarkable. Unfortunately Goro Tanaguchi and his team at Sunrise either didn’t realize the potential of what they’d come up with or were simply too caught up in making a commercially successful product to care. For, you see, although the basic premise survived to see the light of day it has been chained to and obscured by a wide variety of disparate concepts and ideas, none of which add anything of substance to the proceedings. This is a program that wants to be a mecha action series at the same time it wants to be a war drama at the same time it wants to be a romance/harem series at the same time it wants to be a high school comedy while above all else its trying to be Death Note with a copy of V for Vendetta in its pocket. It all gives the impression of a program that’s so terribly frightened of being disliked by any one subset of the anime fandom that it rushes to appeal to every conceivable kind of viewer and as a result is never truly exceptional at any of the things it attempts.\n\nGiant robots, for example, are thrown in for no better reason than to draw in and satisfy the needs of the giant robot fandom. I don’t have anything against mecha per se but neither do I have any great love for it leaving me rather indifferent to it overall. All I ask is that it adds something to the experience, that there is some concrete purpose for their presence motivated by the narrative, that the giant robots aren’t merely props easily interchangeable with any other fantastical weaponry. Full Metal Panic provides, in its continuity, a fairly detailed justification for how its variation on the giant robot concept came into being. Patlabor provides a similarly believable rationale as well. Ride Back would have had a wonderful thematic connection to its motorcycle/robot hybrids had the creators had the sense to utilize a specific scene outside of the end credits. Code Geass has no such virtue. The “Knightmare frames” come across as a ploy just as empty and cynical as Gonzo’s additions of giant robots to their adaptations of Kurosawa’s Seven Samurai and Dumas’s The Count of Monte Cristo.\n\nThe story itself runs into trouble fairly quickly. In the first episode, Lelouch is inspired to begin his campaign against Britannia when he obtains a supernatural ability called Geass from a mysterious girl wearing a tight-fitting straitjacket. This ability allows him to control the will and actions of anyone he chooses with very few actual limitations. All he needs is direct eye contact with his intended victim and that’s it. By comparison the Death Note has a whole page full of rules and restrictions on its use. As a result, a lot of Death Note’s intrigue is generated from the various ways Light Yagami finds to work with or around those rules. The Geass is almost too powerful by comparison. As a result it makes his decision to start a rebellion in Japan as a means of gaining revenge against his father in Britannia seem a very roundabout way of doing things. It would seem more effective to simply hop a plane home, Geass his way past security to get to his father and that would be the end of it. Its not like Lelouch doesn’t accomplish much the same thing with his brother Clovis at the end of the second episode. Of course, if Lelouch were to actually follow the course simple logic would dictate then he wouldn’t have started his rebellion and Code Geass wouldn’t have had the opportunity to indulge in enough overblown spectacle to shame Michael Bay.\n\nThis problem is further compounded by the revelation in the second episode that Lelouch is some sort of super-genius strategist. It’s never explained to any degree where his ability comes from, whether the creators want the viewer to assume that its some sort of blood inherited trait or that he was simply educated on the subject. The most the viewer is allowed to understand is that Lelouch’s “strategic brilliance” has something to do with the fact that he’s good at chess, which, if you actually accept that, only explains a fraction of the schemes that he devises. In the end, as a character Lelouch comes across as little more than a plot devise, a strategy generating machine that provides the series with its single greatest source of overblown spectacle. \n\nOut of the rest of the cast the only character who made, or I should say had the potential to leave in impression on me was the anti-Britannian rebel Kallen. She receives an entire episode devoted to her background as the daughter of a Japanese mother and a Britannian father. Much is made of her identification with the Japanese side of her parentage and how her deceased brother figures into things and there is indeed potential for something interesting here. Unfortunately nothing is ever done with any of these elements. Everything that was brought up in that episode is quickly shelved and never brought up again. \n\nIt should be noted that a good portion of the issues I have with the show stem from the fact that Code Geass possesses all the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the skull. The result is a heavily calculated experience where the hands of the creators can be clearly seen picking and choosing which ideas or scenarios would have the greatest impact regardless of whether or not they make any sense (coincidences are invoked to the point of absurdity). The first episode alone depicts an ethnic cleansing (a scenario the series portrays twice in its first season) and a bloody mass suicide sure to satisfy the more ghoulish members of the viewership. Fanservice is plentiful and obvious with only a scant few female cast members escaping the first season with their dignity, if they ever had any to begin with. \n\nOn the technical side of things there isn’t really a whole lot I can complain about. The animation is smooth well done. The color scheme employed can be a little too bright and cheery for its own good with purple mechs and a city that is lit with pink lighting at night but that is a minor complaint overall. Character designs come courtesy of CLAMP so if you like their artwork you’ll like what you see here. If you don’t like CLAMP then there isn’t anything in Code Geass that will convince you otherwise. The soundtrack, credited to Hitomi Kuroishi and Kotaro Nakagawa, isn’t anything spectacular but it is nonetheless serviceable. It is a competent presentation overall, if only.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Isambard (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 19, 2007\n\nTheWestExit\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Directed by Goro Taniguchi, arguably one of the best directorial talents left at studio Sunrise, and written by his Planetes screenwriter Ichiro Okouchi, Code Geass promised to be a true epic series in the making. An interesting alternate history, a lead character that promised to evolve into a ruthless rebel seeking revenge against the father and the country that ruined his and his sisters life and a dash of mecha added into the mix for good measure. So why did it turn into such a complete circus? An absolute mess of jumbled ideas never touched upon in any way that isn`t absurd or laughable, a\n\n...\n\ncast of characters who constantly degrade into utter imbeciles and a constantly re-shuffled plot. By the half-way mark of Code Geass, it`s as if focus changed from creating an actually riveting series, to essentially seeing how stupid they could take the whole thing and see how many viewers would go along with the ride.\n\nStory: While Code Geass had an interesting premise that seemingly got off to a good start, it`s unfortunate the creators of the show had no idea how to handle the mass of ideas they had, or perhaps they simply didn`t care. New plot elements are introduced while at the same time are others are pushed back and delayed, sometimes by many episodes, and sometimes taken out of the show entirely, left to be settled in the 2nd season yet to air. The writing completely flat lines half way through and instead of the gripping and fast paced war/revenge story we had, we then dive headfirst into utterly inane romance drama with a resolution so incredibly bone headed that the series has almost turned into a comedy. As the series moves on, almost as if the romance was a checkbox on a &quot;to do&quot; list of the plot, the series gradually builds up again, making you think it may yet recover, despite the still omnipresent idiocy, but the show sees fit to deliver a &quot;plot twist&quot; so completely over the top and ridiculous, the writers have wrecked absolutely everything that the series had built in it`s first half, only to deliver one of the most stupid and pathetic twists in recent years. I can`t imagine the writers had any other intention rather than having the audience laugh at the absurdity of it all. The series seems to want to be so many things at the same time. It wants to be a gripping war story, a drama about revenge, it wants to include romance and tragedy, but without foregoing humour. Unfortuntely it was unable to do any of these right.\n\nSound: Music wise, the show's soundtrack doesn't impress much if you're familiar with Kotaro Nakagawa. His music here is essentially a rehash of mostly every other show he's done and remixed into one soundtrack. The only stand out area are the vocal tracks by Hitomi and Mikio Sakai, but even those are all too familiar if you're aquainted with their previous works. As far as the OP and EDs go, Colors by FLOW is a great accesible song, and Hitomi no Tsubasa by Access is perfectly catchy in that &quot;I wouldn't admit in real life that I like this&quot; way. The rest of the shows selections vary from the uninspired (2nd ED), to mind numbingly awful (ED1 and it's usual Ali Project rehash and the often hated OP2).\n\nCharacter:Just as the plot of the series completely crumbles midway through the series, so do the characters. Completely intolerable and annoying side villains are introduced while other much more interesting ones are left to languich and not to reappear until much later. The constantly annoying Suzaku throughout the show is barely even a character, so much his personality and intentions are a joke. Some characters have their personal development completely eradicated from the series, again only to delay it into a second season, while most are barely given even a cursory look, including even supposedly main antagonists. Worst of all is Lelouch, whose descent into a sort of machiavellian evil was purportedly the series main selling point (Episode 1 &quot;the day the devil was born&quot;), is reduced to an utter half wit, commiting imbecilic mistake after another and constantly proving to be all talk and nothing more. A complete let down in every sense.\n\nValue: A seemingly promising series that eventually degrades into nothing more than fanservice and idiocy. Whatever points the series seemed to want to make in it`s first half are utterly invalidated by it`s second. The lack of any sort of resolution, for anything in the series is as confusing as it is aggravating. Being made to wait 4 months for a completely lackluster &quot;ending&quot; only to find out we`ll have to wait even more for any kind of resolution is ridiculous. Knowing that a second season is in the making is irrelevant, there needs to be some kind of payoff for sitting through 25 episodes of this, and all we are left with is having to wait for another 25 episodes.\n\nEnjoyment: As far as rating this show as an enjoyable new series with promise from a once great director, I`d be hard pressed to give it anymore than a 4. Nevertheless, the shows stupidity and constant excesses at least made it worth watching for a few laughs. Laughing at it of course, not with it. Sunrise seems to be stuck in a rut in terms of how it plans out and executes it`s shows. Mai Hime, Mai Otome, and now Code Geass and unfortunately they don`t seem likely to want to change that formula. I expected much more from the people behind this show, a complete shame.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheWestExit (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 27, 2007\n\nHiromi\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (22/25 eps)\n\n A new Gundam series is being announced! Naruto: Shippuden is finally beginning! KyoAni is doing something new! RomeoXJuliet!\n\nThese are titles that attract us to the newest animes, but Code Geass, much like our beloved Suzumiya Haruhi was (and is) a fall/winter sleeper success. This anime, backed by Sunrise, director Goro Taniguchi (s-CRY-ed, Gun X Sword) and scriptwriter Ichiro Okouchi (Azumanga, RahXephon, Eureka 7) showcases an excellent engine of entertainment. \n\nStory \n\nA key part of any mecha/action anime. Code Geass is set in an alternate reality in which it appears the American Revolution during the late 1700s was quelled and Britain went on to conquer the\n\n...\n\nrest of the Americas. Thus, the Holy Britannian Empire became the world's largest superpower, covering 1/3 of the world. On August 10th, 2010, a.t.b, Japan is conquered by the Empire, renamed to Area 11 while her people are designated as 'elevens' and have their rights stripped. Thus begins the story of Code Geass, the tale of Lelouch Lamperouge, eleventh prince of the Empire and his ambition to obtain revenge on the Empire through whatever means necessary. Through the use of this alternate reality setting, we&rsquo;re definitely given something out of the ordinary. Code Geass brings a new spice to an old genre. Code Geass hops along with an arc to arc system with a few lighthearted episodes to mix things up. The story builds with each arc (obviously) to the climax. Although the rising action allows for few breaks, the viewer is never overwhelmed with information or under whelmed by a standstill. As each arc progresses to its end, we&rsquo;re given answers to previous questions yet new ones always arrive &ndash; it&rsquo;s this sense of mystery that really gives Geass its draw for attention.\n\nPros: Intriguing political, action, dramatic and moral oriented story. The questions never stop &ndash; the viewer is always left wanting to discover and see more. Light hearted episodes here and there, placed very well (ex..The School Festival).\n\nCons: A few scenes may turn people off on the series &ndash; something parts may seem excessively strange (read: some to some people). Again, I&rsquo;d like to reiterate that for a mecha fan, I&rsquo;m assuming you&rsquo;ll be watching this for either story or super awesome mecha battles &ndash; you&rsquo;ll get both from this.\n\nCharacters \n\nThe main characters are all extremely well devised by the hands of the all female group, CLAMP. Besides their high aesthetic appearance, each character harbors a separate and distinctive personality essential to the story. For example, Lelouch and Suzaku, opposing main characters and best friends both suffer from a very Machiavellian, &quot; Do the ends justify the means,&quot; syndrome. Lelouch is willing to do anything to further his goals however Suzaku remains wary of what must be done and what should be done. Code Geass shows us the characters inside the mechs; they're not clean cut: &quot;I fight to protect someone I care about.&quot; Each character must weigh the morality of their options as influenced by their past where the correct decision may place them farther from their goals. \n\nPros: Large cast of balanced characters providing a wide arrange of personalities and moral conjectures. Characters are quirky and enjoyable.\n\nCons: Only the main characters matter; anyone else is pushed to the sidelines (i.e. their stories are never a main focus).\n\nThe Battles\n\nCode Geass delivers during its extremely well devised battle scenes. Battles seem as if they were an entirely seperate anime; lines are drawn, ace pilots face off and the battlefield is real. Geass takes a new twist on &quot;main-characters-destroy-grunts-then-whoever-else-battles&quot; and puts us right in the intensity. As said above, there is a large array of characters, interesting on both the &quot;good&quot; side and the &quot;bad&quot; side (which is which is up to you). The battlefield pits them against each other in a deatch match where we know one has to lose yet we are sympathetic to characters on both sides. This sort of conflict draws out the most amazing and interesting battles you can get from a mecha series of this time. Battlefields are led by commanders (obviously) who must make judgements based on his or her opponents's tactics and information - the strategem of battles only adds to the entertainment. The complexity and chaos of a battle give the illusion that you are watching a real war happening right before your eyes. \n\nAnimation \n\nNot much to say here; Sunrise puts money into this, characters look great, mechs look great, everything looks great. However, the art design may put some people off; characters are very tall and lanky (as expected from CLAMP) while grunt mechs are generally unimpressive. Overall though animation is on the high end of the spectrum even during low budget episodes.\n\nOverall \n\nCode Geass is probably one of the few mecha anime's that will appeal to more than just action fans. Battles are kept to a minimum: the main attraction consists of Japanese nationalism against foreign invaders, their actions which undoubtedly cause bloodshed in the name of peace. One of the themes I enjoyed was the balance between cause and effect. Characters were constantly victims of their and others&rsquo; actions this although a given in the real world seems to slip past many other story boards.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Hiromi (\n7\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 24, 2009\n\n-Naami-\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Yet another review for the highly acclaimed Code Geass. I believe this is the 98th review C.G would’ve received; but I can’t help but review this even if so many others have. \n\nHow does such a blatant horribly written show gorging with clichés and plotholes ever be compared to the likes of or considered as Death Note’s rival? I suppose it's because both shows were aired at the same time in Japan. I suppose it's because of \"how uncanny\" the resemblance between the two anti-heros are. And I suppose it's because they feature \"the ends justify the means\" views and morals. I started\n\n...\n\nwatching because of the many reviews that has praised this and the amount of people who recommended this for people who liked Death Note. And so I watched it. And regrettably so. \n\nMeet Lelouch Lamperouge. Former prince of the Britannian Empire, previously named “Lelouch Vi Britannia”. He and his younger sister, Nunnally had left the royal family after their mother had been brutally assassinated many years ago and they now live on campus on Ashford Academy, where he also goes to school at. One day, he comes across a beautiful girl named C.C or C2 who gives him the power of Geass which is located in his left eye. His Geass allows him control people and make them do any of his bidding once. He uses this power to crush the Britannian Empire and under the alias “Zero” he leads the Black Knights, a terrorist organisation, and sets out to free the world from Britannia’s clutches.\n\nI wonder how many clichés we already encountered in that paragraph. We have the “secretly a prince” cliché, the “school environment” cliché, the “mysterious and beautiful girl” cliché and the “revenge on killing my mommy” cliché. And that’s just the beginning.\n\nThe story is just one big mess. It had more plot holes than the ozone layer. They just keep adding and adding to the plot but do nothing about it. To keep up with the ‘story’ I had to constantly read the episodes summaries in Wikipedia, which I never had to do with any other series. And quite frankly, this has got to be the most boring series ever. I bet if they took out the mecha part of this the show would’ve been a flop. \n\nCharacters. We have a number of characters in this show, whom are mostly ineffective and does not add to the story whatsoever. Why the need for so many characters? Throughout the whole series I think I remembered 5 characters out of a cast of 50+. The White Knights didn’t do much; neither did the Chinese government and where the hell did that guy who I assume is the glasses-girl-who’s-madly-in-love-with-Princess-Euphemia boyfriend come from?!\n\nLelouch has got to be the most overrated character ever. We’re told he’s smart but so far all I’ve seen is that he’s good at chess. His strategies are bland and under explained to the point where logic seemed to be extinct when coming up with them, as if he just guesses the next move to take correctly. And he is the worst anti-hero I’ve come across. The way tactlessly kill innocent humans isn’t justified to well either. It was quite a bore to see him ‘use’ people, but not actually manipulate him; like getting close to them and puppeteer them in such a way that angers the viewer. But instead, the viewer doesn’t feel anger towards Lelouch for being such a bastard prick who play with people because he DOESN’T play with them. The viewer feels nothing: no anger, no sadness nor even excitement as he continues killing people. In other words, he fails at being an anti hero. \n\nAnother thing. The Geass. He can make any person do his bidding once. And that’s about it. He doesn’t try to find any way around the Geass, how he can use it or anything of that nature. Totally boring. \n\nNormally having different art styles is one of the plus sides of anime. However, the art in this had me cringing. The characters are disturbingly anorexic, all of them being 6ft tall and 40kg heavy. It was just ridiculous. The noses are undefined and oddly shaped, as for the rest of their sack of bones of a body. The animators weren’t afraid to show scantily clad woman at the drop of a hat either. Ecchi in this show managed to exceed that of a sleazy harem, and fan service covered just about every minute of this anime. \n\nThe only thing I can salute Code Geass for is the music. They manage to skilfully implement everything from jazz music to marching band trumpets in the show. However the openings were a bit of a let down, with average J-Pop taking the spot. \n\nOverall I believe this just seems to be an anime where the creators tried to throw in as many clichés as they can possible and tried to make it an intelligent anime but have failed miserably. Have I mentioned how BORED I was from this? I’m surprised how masochistic I’ve become and actually watched 15 episodes of R2 before it became too much and dropped it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by -Naami- (\n18\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 15, 2008\n\nTheLlama\n\nRecommended\n\n Code Geass is set in a alternate reality where the Britannian Empire has conquered more than one third of the world and counting, and that includes Japan. In said Japan, now called &quot;Area 11&quot; - and its inhabitants &quot;elevens&quot; -, a Britannian student named Lelouch Lamperouge finds himself thrown into a cycle of events that ultimately leads to him gaining a power known as the &quot;Geass&quot;, a power allowing him to force anyone to obey any order he gives to them. Together with his hate for Britannia, he uses his newfound powers to gain followers and eventually bring forth a war against the oppressive Britannian\n\n...\n\nEmpire.\n\nThe story skips along at a fast pace, taking the viewer through one event after another, spending neither too little time nor too much time on each event. And skipping has a more literal meaning here too; the story tends to take small jumps here and there, not explaining the events in between until a bit later. This may come off as a little confusing, but it's also a nice way of keeping you wondering what's going on and what's going to happen next. It doesn't lack twists and turns either, and especially towards the end will you get some unexpected yet pivotal twists.\n\nOne of the things I love about Code Geass is that it frequently delves into subplots, something which would've normally been bad for a two-season series. However, despite their initial prospects of irrelevancy towards the main story, in the end they serve a purpose in the grand perspective, either by moving the plot forward or by presenting character development. These subplots also help keep the show a refreshing and interesting watch.\n\nOn top of that there's a lot of ideology in the picture, both on a political and a personal level. The Britannian Empire has their share of - in my opinion - wrong beliefs. The most obvious one is the racism they're displaying towards the inhabitants of the territories Britannia has conquered - or Numbers, as they call them. They also follow social Darwinism, which is basically the principle of natural selection implemented into human society. Stupid beliefs, if you ask me. But not everyone thinks so, it would seem.\n\nThe more intriguing ideologies are found when we move down to the personal level, though, with Lelouch and Suzaku's differing beliefs being the root of a ideological conflict. While their goals are more or less the same, they differ in their views on which methods should be used to accomplish the goals - Lelouch believes that the end justifies the means no matter what, while Suzaku believes that peace by murder is wrong. This conflict between two best friends (when not in battle) is a really interesting one, because it is so representative of the moral conflict that's presented - who is good, and who is bad? Britannia - or Zero? Decide for yourself who you want to sympathize with.\n\nMany people have compared Code Geass with Death Note, saying that it is the same, just with mecha. While it is easy to see where that is coming from, it is only on the surface that this is true. Both series' main characters are very intelligent and analytical fellows who believe that the world must be changed through bloodshed, and they both have some supernatural power. But that's all there is to it. Aside that they're as different as day and night. As a character and human being, Lelouch is a thousand times more believable than Light, mostly because he is explored much more than Light is; all we got to see in Death Note was Light's intelligence and analytical capabilities, while in Code Geass we actually get to explore Lelouch as a human, and partake in his emotional experiences, be it love or interaction with his friends, victory or defeat. And aside the two of them, I couldn't really find any similarities between the two shows. Hence, you may like one and not the other, so if you've watched Death Note and did not like it (:o), you may still like Code Geass.\n\nCode Geass also presents a huge array of supporting characters. Some are more one-dimensional and clich&eacute; than others, yet they all have their defined personalities and roles in the story. Some of them are developed in a great way, and come off as believable during their exposition. The subplots mainly focus on them, and either develops the characters or the story, and it's interwoven with the main story in a truly great way.\n\nCode Geass, both story- and character-wise, builds up more and more towards the end; the impending climax becoming more and more evident after each and every episode. Finally, in the last two episodes, the fuse has run out, and the bomb blows. In the end however, what one will see is the smoke and not the results of the big explosion; you are left with one massive cliffhanger that'll make you long for - no, need to watch the second season.\n\nCharacter designs are done by CLAMP, and anyone who've watched or read one of their works will know what to expect in this department: Tall and lanky characters. It's a style that may be new and unusual for many, but it really grows on you, and you can't help but think that it looks good enough, even though their proportions are off. The animation isn't anything spectacular in other departments, but it's good. Great special effects and detailed surroundings help on the aesthetic pleasure too, and aesthetics is something which is important to me when I watch an anime. The coloring is fresh and vivid, however often too much so; at times it could've probably gained from having a darker color tone. Nevertheless, it was well done. The action scenes are made out well, with smooth animation and great mecha movement, and just the right effect of chaos that's needed during intense battles. There is some reusing of the &quot;Geass-effect&quot;; the special effects they use when Lelouch uses the Geass, and while cool the first few times, it gets a bit annoying in its persistence.\n\nI have to admit, I'm a sucker for the type music they used in Code Geass. Utilizing voices instead of instruments makes for an experience that I just fall completely for, and several insert songs make it even better. Some background themes are reused a lot, but my, are they effectual. The opening and ending themes aren't especially noteworthy, unless you're a fan of the artists performing the songs, that is. The first ending theme is made by Ali Project, and I have to say, I've grown to like their style a lot.\n\nCode Geass can be summarized to an anime that doesn't produce anything that's over the top or exceptional, but it does give us is one helluva experience with great characters, intriguing ideologies as well as a twisted plotline that ends in a cliffhanger so massive it could kill you!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheLlama (\n65\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 22, 2007\n\n7Th\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Probably one of the most blatantly obvious train-wrecks of bad writing in the history of serial visual narrative production, shamefully destroying its own at first stimulating concept of alternate reality with awful characterizations, extremely weak script and cheap developments that only serve the purpose of working as a &ldquo;shock-factor&rdquo; to keep the audience entranced beyond the notice of a very clear lack of sequential planning.\n\nHonestly speaking, the show is certainly fun and even held itself within certain quality standard during the irregularly interesting initial 11 episodes but as characters exponentially lose their own minds and personalities we are nothing else but witnesses of the now\n\n...\n\nclassical conceptual phrase in entertainment: &ldquo;jumping the shark&rdquo;. By the badly plotted twist in its &ldquo;praised by the masses&rdquo; stage 22 the series barely keeps itself as dirty and trashy fun that that makes you willingly embrace the filth of Japanese animation: the very price of marketing in a ridiculous attempt at dramatic storytelling that takes to oblivion without any justification its own suspension of disbelief. \n\nThe core problem is, of course, Lelouch. Some may argue it&rsquo;s hard to portray a genius but in the end it&rsquo;s as simple as keeping him from committing underdeveloped mistakes just for the sake of progressing the chronicled history. Not to mention how the rest of cast just acts without any justification whatsoever and never lives up to their indicated development or makes any attempt at decently stopping their inevitable crash into mediocrity. Nevertheless I got to admit that despite her poor dialogs Cornelia remained amazingly likeable, and that must say something about the value hidden in the idea of her original concept.\n\nAnd so, with the lack of any real literary theme so to speak besides the hilariously exploitative Machiavellian motivation of its ridiculous excuse for a lead, the show honors the words of director Goro Tanigushi and exists as just an excuse to create a &ldquo;hit show&rdquo; to appeal both males and females. He succeeded for sure, shame it was at the cost of all the artistic merits of the finalized production.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by 7Th (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 25, 2008\n\niamjoe\n\nRecommended\n\n Code Geass is awesome. If you have any qualms against it, whether you dislike mecha or anything like that, put it aside and watch a few episodes. Then you'll see what I mean when I say that Code Geass is a great anime. \n\nIf you want an anime that is going to leave you on the edge of your seat, biting your nails, waiting impatiently for the next scene--this is for you. \n\nArt is pretty decent. It's very colourful. The animation is also good--the action sequences are well drawn. \n\nThe characters are all interesting. Never have I seen an anime with a cast of\n\n...\n\nso many anti-heroes before: lots of jerks, losers, obsessed freaks, and extremists, but they manage to make you intrigued with their lives and the happenings around them. \n\nThe sound was also decent. A lot of trumpet and sweeping epic battle pieces that complement what happens on the screen. \n\nCode Geass is so original as well. It's about colonialism, if you caught it. It's like a cool History lesson--but with mechs. This is certainly one of the best anime to have been released this century. \n\nWatch it. It's totally fabulous.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by iamjoe (\n29\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 18, 2007\n\nXerxes4158\n\nRecommended\n\n Some people like to attribute Code Geass's success to the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha. Personally, I'd like to think that it succeeds (critically) despite the fact that it is a Sunrise mecha. Code Geass manages to establish a believable backdrop from which it launches a compelling plot along with motivated and realistic characters, something that has been missing from the last few Gundam series produced by Sunrise. It injects a plot where the focus is finally on the characters and the events surrounding them, rather than the machines that they use to fight. In fact, it could be\n\n...\n\nsaid that Code Geass only qualifies as a mecha anime due to the existence of the machines - they are in no way integral to the plot nor its development anymore than a tank or any other weapon that the characters may be using (aside from the mysterious &quot;Geass&quot; itself).\n\nGeass's plot is strengthened by its attention to detail in the geopolitical climate that the series quickly establishes from the get-go. While the setting isn't too unique for a futuristic mecha (world divided between multiple superpowers, belligerent native populations fight to reestablish their cultural identity, etc.), the way the events are interwoven with one another sets itself up as being above the status quo. Code Geass also manages to ask some of the questions that other futuristic plots seemingly neglect, either through purposeful avoidance or just through sheer ignorance. From a political / sociological perspective, the setting and the development are especially engaging, posing questions on the topics of nationalism, racism, genocide, and the rules of war to the audience. While you shouldn't expect any profoundly new ideas to arise from the series, the fact that the writers and creators did weave these ideas into the ongoing plot makes the world both more realistic as well as more theoretical at the same time, providing both an environment for the characters to exist in as well a philosophical establishment that they can debate. \n\nHowever, the writers do not merely craft a beautiful world and leave it alone - instead, they focus much of their attentions, especially in the latter half of the season, towards physically and metaphysically deconstructing the world, both in the direct, tangible actions of the characters as well as the moral questions surrounding their resolve and trains of thought. Such is the development of the actual plot of Code Geass: fluid, dynamic, and engaging. While not entirely unpredictable, the plot's development is seamless in terms of being able to logically move from one event to another, such that the implications of a &quot;cause and effect&quot; paradigm can be observed. At the same time, the plot is also not so simplistic as to be a &quot;Point A -&gt; Point B -&gt; Point C&quot; formula. Instead, we witness the joining and interweaving of multiple, distinct plot lines, which at first glance are independent of one another, but towards the end fuse into one. Then, Code Geass throws us a curveball, and splits the strands again, preparing us for the upcoming Season 2....\n\nThe greatest relative strength of Code Geass when compared to most other action / mecha anime are its characters and the way they develop. Sunrise made the intelligent decision of contracting CLAMP to design the characters, since they are both visually and emotionally appealing to a wide array of audiences. Internet messageboards are usually torn between the main protagonists and side characters of the story, each holding one above the others for a personal reason that they see within each one of them. In addition, the side characters are not there merely for ornamentation - even the seemingly minor characters at the sides of the main few are given room to develop with their own storylines and reactions, such that we are never really compelled to dismiss characters as merely being &quot;filler fodder&quot;. Prepare to be intrigued by these individuals - from the psychological coldness of Lelouch, to the restrained idealism of Suzaku and Kallen, to the overall question mark that is C.C. The reactions of the individuals combine to form distinct, evolving psychological profiles, allowing the series to be populated by a cadre of multifaceted individuals.\n\nWhile Code Geass is extremely successful from a storytelling perspective, it does have its faults, especially on the technical side. Plain and simple, the fight scenes were not too impressive. That is not to say that they were awful, but the mecha and battle scenes definitely did not compare tot he fluidity of the script nor the depth of the characterization. In addition, especially towards the latter third of the season, the plot does take a few freedoms with regards to suspension of disbelief, as well as falling into the trap of rapidly switching between &quot;tragically dramatic&quot; to &quot;comically relieving&quot; scenes. However, these are minor problems, especially the &quot;bloated plotlines&quot;, which fixes itself by the end of the series. I also would not recommend this series to mecha addicts who are genuinely more interested in awesome combat scenes between mechas, since Code Geass will not live up to your expectations. However, for the rest of you, even if you have never considered picking up a mecha anime to watch, pick up Code Geass, it is sure to not disappoint.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Xerxes4158 (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 5, 2008\n\nGolbeztheGreat\n\nRecommended\n\n Code Geass is one of those series that can inspire praise, hatred or mere ridicule, depending on what is expected or what can be tolerated. Curiously, I find entirely valid reasons behind each of those reactions. There's still a bit of this and that, to put it bluntly, but perhaps the lines aren't quite as clear as they seem.\n\nIn short, I enjoyed the series and still find that its virtues and sheer fun factor outweigh its objective flaws, but I'm worried about the future. Whether or not the inevitable sequel picks up the slack, addresses existing concerns or drops the ball completely is something that\n\n...\n\nonly Sunrise knows at this point. In any case, we might as well enjoy what we can.\n\nStory: \n\nThe premise is melodramatic and ambitious enough. Lelouch, the protagonist, is embarking on a personal quest through the use of his intellect and a mysterious power, motivated by personal revenge and morally ambiguous altruism. The setting is divided into two spheres, the edgier world of military/politics and the more carefree environment of the Ashford academy, with their respective casts of characters. There's a clear element of mecha action here as well, even if it's not really the main attraction and doesn't dominate the show.\n\nThe pace is definitely fast and unrelenting...perhaps it's all a bit much for Lelouch's and the story's own good, though, as things turn out. The writing and direction can be uneven during the weaker moments, but are absolutely thrilling at their best. Most of it develops quite nicely, with some general predictability and a few genuine surprises that keep things interesting. \n\nThe biggest concerns are certain major twists which threaten to overwhelm the viewer, if they are not enjoyed or understood. Intentional and unintentional humor, such as Pizza Hut's sponsorship or many over the top sequences, can be occasionally distracting as well. I personally felt that the basic focus is never lost, however, when all is said and done, in spite of a few undeniable blunders or red herrings.\n\nIn the end, we've only seen half the story and, for better or for worse, the upcoming sequel has the responsibility of providing true resolution. Or at least trying to do so in an interesting way, whether it fails or succeeds at it.\n\nAnimation:\n\nProduction values are good and tend to stay consistent. I've never been a CLAMP fan, mostly due to unfamiliarity, so their original character designs for Code Geass -while distinctive and attractive- don't really impress me too much. They may also look strange from certain angles. The mechanical designs are just fine for the show's purposes, with a couple of particularly well done models. \n\nSound:\n\nThe music is appropriate and mostly unobtrusive, whether the mood is serious, exciting, relaxed, mischievous, dramatic or tragic. Not exactly the best soundtrack I've ever heard, as a few tracks could use more variety. The opening and ending themes are quite well done, as a rule, and tend to fit the show. Naturally, your mileage may vary here.\n\nCharacter:\n\nFor someone who is often accused of being a copycat there are certain nuances to Lelouch's personality that set him apart, such as his emotional range and a sense of humanity emerging from his internal conflicts or character flaws. Predictably, the protagonist himself carries the show on his back and receives the most development, which is good since he does deserve much of it and this makes him an interesting subject of study. Having said that, said development has at least one major drawback: it may not be what people are expecting and finding certain events relatively disappointing or even anti-climatic is quite possible. Suzaku, who also plays an important role as Lelouch's foil, has a self-righteous personality and his interference can be very annoying to witness. He does have some complexity though, even if it's still a hard sell for those who find themselves sympathizing with Lelouch/Zero. C.C. herself is mysterious enough, as we've only seen bits and pieces of information regarding her background thus far, but remains an intriguing and generally fun character by virtue of her interactions with Lelouch. \n\nSecondary characters tend to get some attention too, with interesting results in the major cases whether you appreciate their fates or not. The big issue for me is that the cast of characters might seem a bit too large as the show goes on, with a couple of unnecessary additions towards the later half that tend to delay, limit or rush development. Still, this is the kind of show where such size makes sense on paper given its scope, but as a result we will have to wait for the sequel in order to see if a few questionable plot threads are continued, resolved or at least replaced.\n\nEnjoyment:\n\nThe first season of Code Geass, even though I wasn't entirely convinced about certain plot twists and openly laughed along with certain sequences or developments, was certainly entertaining and rarely boring. \n\nIn short, I appreciated both the genuinely well-done portions and several of the more absurd scenarios. The show is not a masterpiece by any means, nor is it going to please every sector of the audience that it will initially attract. I'd still be perfectly happy to recommend it to those who haven't seen it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by GolbeztheGreat (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 17, 2008\n\nholdenn\n\nRecommended\n\n There some mecha's that achieve near brilliance, and others that are rendered useless in their awkward failure. Code Geass is neither of this. \n\nI started Code Geass as soon as the first episode aired.. Yes, I have enjoyed it very much. But to my surprise, on the arrival of the 13th episode, Code Geass took the anime industry by storm. Like a moth to a flame, people crowded the anime and simply worshiped it(God knows how many CC fans are being born as of this moment). Much as Ive enjoyed Code Geass, it does not do justice to be considered what it is today. In\n\n...\n\nfact I feel its popularity is similar to FMA, both are highly enjoyable but nowhere near being the masterpiece people claim it to be.\n\nCode Geass is not a sight to behold, but rather a sight to gather thousands of fans within only barely dozen of episodes. Spectacle, after all, is Code Geass specialty, not subtlety, so enjoying the sum of the parts sometimes requires dispassionate detachment or at least blind belief. But whether you think Code Geass is absurd or lacking originality, Code Geass is one of the most fun and engaging anime's in recent memory, as long as you don't think about it too hard.\n\nJapan, being defeated by the empire of Britannia, whose territory reaches nearly one third of the world thanks to their high-tech war machines called Knightmares, was renamed to Area 11. Britannia swiftly depraved the Elevens(Japanese) of their pride, rights and isolated them from the migrating citizens of Britannia, leaving them to poverty.\n\nThis is where our main boy steps in. Lelouch, a young former prince of Britannia who was known to have passed away, not to mention a cheap ripoff of Light Yagami from Death Note. During a battle between the Britanna and a scarce amount of rebelling Elevens, Lelouch finds a capsule containing a naked woman, who gives Lelouch Geass, a mysterious ability that can control any human simply by looking them in the eyes and speaking his commands. And because that it just so happens that Lelouch has this great animosity for the Brittania, he plans to single handedly face the tyrant. \n\nLelouch under the alias of Zero, becomes a hope to the elevens and a threat to Britannia.\n\nIts hard not to compare Lelouch from Yagami Light of Death Note. But if you can get past it, you'll find out something more. Coming with a tragic past pre-installed, it may seem that Lelouch is your typical apprehended teenager(Gundam anyone?). But Lelouch in a way, is a revenge-driven genius who would dare to go against the world to reach his goals and doesnt endlessly desires to just die without a fight. He even has the discernment for seizing control of the situation and directs the terrorist group by radio, controlling them and anticipating the moves of the Britannian forces like it was a game of chess.\n\nIt isnt entirely plausible how is still able to manage a double life and lead the Japanese to victory. But it does provide Lelouch moments to look more sympathetic and less unrealistic.\n\nSo yeah thats pretty much what you need to know. Lelouch battles Britannia with the help of the ever so gullible and disposable Japanese. Oh and I forgot to mention Suzaku,an Eleven who is his childhood friend, siding to Britannia. They both basically the want the same thing, only they have different methods. Lelouch wants to rid of Britannia to make the world easier for his sister to live in, Nunally. Suzaku, on the other hand, wants to climb the ladders of Britannia, and gradually change it to good from the inside. \n\nThere's a ton going on in these first five episodes, and the pacing is rapid-fire. Add in a truly epic stage, some awesome battles, and just a dash of comedy to keep things from getting too dark, and it's really hard to see where this show can go wrong from here. \n\nCode Geass is majestic, in terms of entertaining. The plot twists are so twisted that it becomes endless and absurd. Every episode ends in marvelous cliffhangers that can make you get a garotte wire and strangle yourself for an entire week until the next episode comes out and makes you do the same thing all over again. It just keeps getting better and better.\n\nThe actions are also a treat. From assault to massive warfare, Code Geass is impressively detailed. The contest between Britannia and the Eleven are as breathtaking as they are thrilling, while the individual battles are supremely well choreographed.\n\nCode Geass has so many things working in its favor that it becomes easy to overlook some of its flaws.\n\nThe animation is completely convincing and fulfills the shows &quot;mecha plausibility&quot; quotient well besides than the roller blading war machines. Moreover, few if any prior shows have as effectively integrated the tacky yet refined movements of the robots as they do here. CLAMP did the designs here so be sure to expect it to be excellent(and have arms, which have uncanny ability to stretch an extra three feet)\n\nThe music is fluid. It always depicts the sound perfectly. Be it a gunshot or a whole building crumbling down, it is nicely executed. The background effects are also a plus. You get to hear a bunch of insects flying around or birds chirping.\n\nIt gives a rather credible atmosphere partnered by a perfect atmospheric melody. The clarity of the sound effects definitely supports the anime very well.\n\nVoice acting is no slouch either. It can easily persuade you of the emotion of each characters tries to convey, even supporting characters are given enough to time to emote.\n\nThe results are predictably impressive, even genre-defining. However as good as Code Geass is in terms of spectacle, the show does hit a few dud notes in terms of plot and characterization. But put together with visual flair, it&rsquo;s a winning combination that helps to ensure Code Geass is a roller coaster experience of thrilling intensity.\n\nJust like Da Vinci Code, it is &quot;preposterously entertaining&quot;.It is safe to say that anyone who's interested in action or mecha will go bananas over Code Geass.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by holdenn (\n16\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 1, 2008\n\ngame8910\n\nRecommended\n\n At first when i heard of how great Geass was and then I learned it was a mecha show, I was a bit reluctant to watch it since I am not a big fan of mecha. But once I sat down and watched code geass I was really impressed at how good it was.\n\nStory: The story of this anime is one of the best I've seen and it is highly enjoyable. At the end of every episode I had the urge to quickly watch the next because of how incredible this show was giving you all this conflict and plot twists at would just leave\n\n...\n\nyou shocked. I could feel the intensity of the situations at times and not many shows can do that. Another plus is that it was not 100% mecha and it has its elements of mystery in it because of the actual geass power. And the story is not yet over since they give you an ending that just breaks your heart knowing that you're gonna have to wait a couple months to figure out what happened. Cliffhangers are EVIL!!!\n\nArt: CLAMP, not everyone likes their style of drawing but in my case I am a nut for CLAMP so I found this show's animation really good. The colours were so bright and pretty for an anime that IMO is rather dark and serious. All the robots looks great and have flashy and pretty designs to them, the Lancelot looks SO COOL XD\n\nSound: The only thing that I didnt find outstanding about the show was the music, some of the background songs I kinda disliked since it seemed like it wasnt really fit for the moment. But overall it was still good. I guess I should comment at how great Lelouch's seiyuu did a great job playing him.\n\nCharacter: Lelouch is probably one of the main reasons I like Geass, the conflicts he suffers and how he plays some of the other characters is just awesome. Suzaku on the other hand, I dont really like how he is trying to achieve his plans and should just die v_v but thats what makes geass good since it allows me to really get attached to the characters and grow to love or HATE them. Oh and C.C = win.\n\nEnjoyment: I have really enjoyed watching Geass it has given me one of the best storytelling and even some really cool action as well. And with the new season coming my excitement has once again returned.\n\nOverall Geass is one of the best mecha shows out there and if you are a mecha fan this show has a lot of other aspects that will definitely draw you in. This is one of the best shows out there and should not be missed by anyone. In my case, I'm just glad season 2 is coming out soon.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by game8910 (\n36\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 22, 2009\n\nphpwind6\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Code Geass is the most overrated anime on the top 20 list. \n\n Although it has a fast-paced plot with quite a few surprises along the way (which is why I finished 25 episodes), I cannot help but feel that it was a complete waste of time.\n\n It seems to me that the creators of Geass sit together, with trend analysis graphs and bar charts on the table, pick out popular elements of the recent years and just throw them into this anime.\n\n So at the end, we get a villain as the main character (Death Note?), lots of\n\n...\n\nmoral dilemmas, lots of angst and shocks, but no real focus or passion in the story. Characters are 2-dimensional and boring, their actions are completely driven by the plot. And the plot tries its best to deliver as much angst and surprises as possible just for the sake of it.\n\n If you haven't watch it yet, don't waste your time.

However, it has its hits and misses.\n\nStory\n\nCompared to many other anime items I've watch, Code Geass's plot twists and unfolds with shocking pace compared to the usually expected sluggishness found in most 20+ episode series. The 25 episodes of the first season would have been enough to supply like 75 episodes One Piece style (no offense to OP: I like it no less than Code Geass).\n\nThis, however,\n\n...\n\nplaced its toll on the story's coherence. Near the end, it might even become somewhat confusing, as if the authors looked at all the possible outcome scenarios and picked the most shocking ones, without paying much attention to how well they would fit. I can't confidently say if its a good or a bad thing, I guess we'll only know for sure after season 2. So far, I'd easily give it a 10 for pace and courage in plot twisting, but after seeing it all I think I'll place some penalty to emphasize that the story could use some more work when it comes to adequacy.\n\nArt\n\nI'll be honest: I don't like CLAMP's character design, not even one bit. I'd prefer any Satoshi Kon's or Katsuhiro Otomo's movie characters to it any day. I like the characters to look realistic, and here I see typical bishounen boys and comparably cute girls. No wait, boys are apparently more cute here. Much so. Cause all of them look like, you know, androgynes. And size differences between, say, Lelouch's frame and Emperor's frame are shocking.\n\nI'm actually surprised how can these boys even move so fast with those frail limbs.\n\nAnimation is very good, though, action scenes are fluid and detailed. Also, lots of blood, many deaths. Be aware.\n\nSound\n\nMusic is fast and catchy, very fitting for a story like this. I didn't like it much, though, except for the second opening starting midway through the series. Rest of the sound work is fine, if you don't count somewhat annoying voices and public domain samples used in several scenes.\n\nCharacters\n\nTough to say. On one hand, characters are active and vivid. On another, they can annoy you easily (easily!). Some characters could use more development, some abandoned their development whatsoever. Some you will wish didn't die, some you will definitely wish to have died.\n\nWhat definitely contributes to my own displease is that the characters are very easy to make a decision no matter how major and complicated the matter is, which makes their actions seem less natural and more &quot;eh, they totally saw that coming&quot; throughout. Moreover, while many of the main characters' motives are deep and somewhat disturbing, all their thoughts are immediately relevaled, leaving less to think through and analyze, which makes it easier to understand than something like Evangelion, but at the same time detracts from long term enjoyability. There is little point in solving riddles when you're given an answer before you even have a chance to realize that.\n\nAlso, it looks like the entire cast of main and supporting characters was composed of Mensa members. You'll see what I mean when you watch it.\n\nEnjoyment\n\nOne undisputable factor such fast paced story usually contributes to is the thrill. That's right, Code Geass is thrilling, interesting and unpredictable, with numerous comedy elements, little fan service and fascinating action scenes. Just what I like in series like this. A well deserved 10 from me.\n\nOverall\n\nCode Geass is an enjoyable watch, clever and surprising. However, its story leaves something to be desired, in both possible senses.\n\nAlso, don't watch the Recaps together with the main episodes: they disrupt the pace without contributing any new content. Better use them instead of rewatching in case you want to refresh the memories of the events happened. Specials (the non-animated shorts) can be watched at any time, provided you won't watch them before the corresponding events in the main series.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by moozooh (\n45\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 13, 2014\n\ni_want_ultima\n\nNot Recommended\n\n (this review will cover elements from R2 and R1)\n\nThere will probably be a large amount of people who will look at the score I gave code geass and click the \"not helpful\" button without even bothering to read the first few lines of this review. If this is you, I don't believe you should bother reading this review in the first place, since your mind is obviously not going to be changed. And also, this review is all my own opinion, the large majority of you will probably enjoy code geass a lot, but if you want to hear a different opinion then go ahead\n\n...\n\nand read the review. \n\nIntelligent anime. Its probably one of my favourite types of anime. It's so much nicer to get enthralled, shocked, and mindblown by an anime rather than to turn your brain off and enjoy a bunch of generic bullshit that basically copies every other mildly successful show in its genre. Unfortunately however, for every actually intelligent anime there is an equal number of, if not even more shows for which their intelligence is only superficial. While you may not (and probably won't) agree, I believe code geass is one of these shows. \n\nWhen I first heard of code geass, it was described to me as \"death note with mechs\". Although the manga was a lot better, I actually enjoyed death note, and I dove into code geass hoping for another helping of interesting characters, and a relatively well paced and clever plot. For me, code geass was just a huge load of cliches, underdeveloped characters, and extremely convenient coincidences all wrapped up together to make a quite lackluster anime. Although I'm not going to go over every single little thing, since that would take forever and I'm too lazy, code geass had almost as may plot holes as mirai nikki (although that also has a mean score over 8, so that shows you something)\n\nIt's very surprising how people try to compare lelouch and Light, or the strategic planning that both shows supposedly have. While they were often unrealistic and sometimes made no sense, the plans in death note obviously had a lot of though put into them, and the dialogue passing between Light and L was interesting enough to keep you engrossed in the story. However, all that the so called \"strategy\" in code geass equates to is \"My mech is bigger and more badass than yours.\" the large majority of battles the black knights face in this anime are won by lelouch procuring a new bigger and more powerful weapon that they use to eliminate the opposition. And when he actually does any real planning it's consisted of lelouch conveniently guessing the opponents next moves as if he's some kind of psychic. As the show goes on he seems to putt less and less logic into his plans. Especially the way they escaped the britannian empire by all dressing up as zero. That was less like a carefully derived strategy and more like something and more like a retarded idea lelouch came up with after he'd had one too many beers. If the britannians honestly couldn't come up with a way to thwart that, then it's no surprise they got outsmarted.\n\nAnother annoying Element of code geass is the characters. Unless its a show with an above average amount of episodes, or one that is not character driven, good shows often take the route of keeping the cast of characters smaller, and developing those characters further. However, code geass prefers to go to down the path of piling on so many new and completely useless characters that don't garner the slightest bit of interest from the viewer or develop the plot in any reasonable way that you forget the name of anyone who's not a main character. The white knights did fuck all, in fact you only knew the names of a few of them, and this was true for a large amount of the cast. a result of this many of the characters got so little development and focus that I couldn't care less what happened to them at all. Even lelouch who is the main character gets stuck with a cliched \"mah parent(s) were killed omg so sad and compelling\" backstory, and thats it.\n\nAs for the art, all of the characters look like lanky anorexic beat sprouts who need to go and eat some big macs, but apart from that it was nothing special, and typical for an anime of its time. The sound quality was actually quite good during the actual episodes, however the openings and endings were just boring J-pop that I skipped every time I watched an episode.\n\nAnother thing I'd like to mention is the fanservice, and this was definitely a lot more prominent in R2. Kallen in her knightmare shot from very suspicious camera angles, Kallen in the shower, and Kallen and CC doing a variety of other things to please the otakus and their penises. It's disheartening that even a so called intelligent anime like code geass ended up throwing in enough fanservice to make an ecchi harem anime jealous. It may have had plot, but it was hard to notice it with kallen's ass getting shoved in your face for half of every episode.\n\nHowever, as the series does not drop below a four, it must have its good points. Despite him being a lot less intelligent than people make him out to be, lelouch was at some points relatively interesting to watch, unlike all the other characters. And although I found the majority of all the episodes boring, the final few episodes of each season piqued my interest a bit (Dat spinzaku), and I didn't mind watching them, although R2s ending is a bit overrated.\n\nOverall, I though that although it had its moments, code geass was overall overrated and slightly below average. although some people reading this will understand what I'm going on about, the majority of people who have seen code geass enjoyed it a lot, and the chances are that you will too. However, I personally would not recommend code geass, and I think there are much better anime you could spend your time watching. For alternate recommendations, if you haven't already seen death note (which is unlikely) go and watch it, or for another mech anime try neon genesis evangelion.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by i_want_ultima (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 25, 2011\n\nartist-retired\n\nRecommended\n\n Code Geass is definitely a very popular anime, no denying that, but I wouldn't exactly call it a master piece, but it is however, a fun and entertaining show, you just don't need to put too much thought into it.\n\nSTORY: Once upon a time, there was a famous animation company that decided to mash up as many genres as they can to make an anime that would try to appeal to as many anime fans as possible.\n\nThe end result was Code Geass, and it was a success, popularity wise.\n\nBut before I get on to the actual review I have to say honestly, I really like\n\n...\n\nthis anime, but it can pretty much ruin the fun of the anime if you try to look at it objectively, but that being said, it's hard not to since this anime tries way too hard to appeal to too many genres that fans are into.\n\nAdmittedly, the story itself is quite interesting, an alternate reality where England, now named Brittania, has taken over the world and just really hates Japan to the point of ethnic cleansing (It's a little unsettling to say the least). But the main focus of the anime is about a royal family member castaway, Lelouch Lamperouge, trying to get revenge on his father, the leader/king of Brittania for the murder of his mother. So yeah, essentially the story is just another revenge story, nothing too original (How are revenge stories so damn popular I will never know).\n\nBut the anime starts to show its short comings, and really early on. The anime tries to make you assume that Lelouch is a genius solely upon him being good at chess, with no other reason, he's genius cause he's a beast at chess, that's it.\n\nThere's no character build up to show he's a genius other than playing chess (But I would not know since I don't play chess, maybe it really does make you a genius, maybe I need to try it out before making this judgement).\n\nAnd besides being a genius, he receives a power which allows him to control people's minds, once per person, called Geass (Get it? Because the show is also called Code \"Geass\"), which by the way, is the best used character/plot device in the anime, and it's entertaining how Lelouch uses it in dangerous situations or when he's trying to outsmart his foes.\n\nHowever, the way he obtains just seems that not enough thought was put into it, in other words, kinda lazy, he meets a girl in a strait jacket being chased by the military, and bam! Mind control powers.\n\nThis is also where you also should realize a major plot hole in the early episodes, with his mind controlling powers, he could get his revenge in a heart beat, but that's not fun to watch at all, but if he could simply kill off one of his family members easily in less than three episodes (Don'y worry, that character's death is just another way to advance the plot), what's keeping him from getting his father like that too?\n\nAdditionally, Lelouch isn't really a likable character (His comes off being arrogant and is just a calculating and sadistic bastard), but the rest of the cast though, have a little more going on for them.\n\nThe benefactor of Lelouch's power, C.C. (Pronounced C2) may not be terribly interesting herself, but like myself, she's just there to watch the whole show play out and snack on pizza (Fun fact, this anime was endorsed/sponsored by a pizza company). \n\nIn fact I would've been fine if her character just died on the first episode (Spoiler: she gets shot in the head), it would've been more interesting to see Lelouch figure his powers all on his own anyway. But apparently, she must have been a favorite of the creators of the anime, enough so they keep her to mess a round with Lelouch and eat pizza, so at least she's amusing.\n\nChildhood friend and some what frienemy of Lelouch, Suzaku, is arguably a better protagonist than Lelouch and was developed into his character much better than Lelouch too, but his focus on what he wants to do isn't exactly clear (I want to save Japan/I want to be a knight for britiania, blah, blah, blah), and though his character development is better than what Lelouch's was, it can be arguably be called lazy, because most of it was through flashbacks to his past, though later episodes are more enjoyable due a girlfriend he gets.\n\nBut, the real stars of the anime are the genres that are ungracefully crammed together.\n\nIt tries to be school life anime, a harem, an action anime, ecchi anime, psychological anime (TRIES to, it isn't), romance anime, and a mecha anime all at the same time, but if you look down at the core of this anime and try to piece it together, you'll realize it's a gigantic mess.\n\nEspecially how this anime tries to integrate mecha (Get it? Because it's called Code Geas... wait, don't the majority of mecha anime have the name of a mecha in it's title? Gurren Lagann or any Gundam for example) into the story, they're just literally there to just be cool and to be used as weapons of war, nothing more, absolutely nothing more. Shallow is a better word to describe it than lazy.\n\nThe anime would honestly be just as effective without the mechs (Apparently the creators are aware of this because two of the manga series have no mechas in them), in fact, it isn't a mecha anime.\n\nA mecha anime is a mecha cause one of it's major focuses is on it's robots, Code Geass focuses on anything else but the mechas, they're there just to appeal to mecha fans, so really there's no point what so ever for the mechas to even exist in this anime, they're just cool to throw in because they're giant robots.\n\nBut, there is one thing this anime knows what it is, a loud cluster f**k of many gernres, and despite that it's not a great anime, it's fun to watch and at least pretend that it knows what it's trying to be.\n\nANIMATION: For me, this is best part of the whole anime, it looks great, the girls are hot, the boys are pretty, everyone wins, plenty of eye candy for all.\n\nEspecially for fans of clamp, who were generous enough to do the character designs.\n\nThe mechas look cool enough, but the stupidest parts on them are the wheels slapped on them, they look so ridiculous. But the action scenes more than compensate for them.\n\nBut other than that, this a gorgeous looking show.\n\nSOUND: Both the Japanese and English voices are great, but I only watched the english dubbed due to my own preferences.\n\nJohnny Young Bosch, Yuri Lowenthal, Michelle Ruff, Steven Blum, Kate Higgins, and so many more top notch notable voice actors are in this anime, but of all of them, Johnny is damn good as Lelouch and Yuri's Suzaku is a great compliment to Johnny's performance.\n\nEach theme music is enjoyable and what you'll except for a mainstream anime, though the back ground music doesn't really stand out.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nThe Good:\n\n+ Very entertaining and fun to watch.\n\n+ Good looking characters designed by Clamp, and great animation overall.\n\n+ Good english dub, Johnny Bosch's Lelouch is arguably one of his best performances.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Can be faulted for trying too hard to appeal to multiple audiences by shallowly cramming genres together.\n\n- There's honestly there's no point of the mechas other than to be used as weapons to fight.\n\n- Weak character development, C.C. honestly feels thrown in.\n\n- Lots of plot holes\n\nDespite what I have said in this review I would still recommend this to any one.\n\nAnd I'm surprised I didn't reference Death Note once in this review... Wait a minute... Damn, so close.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by artist-retired (\n51\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 10, 2015\n\ndefunctmaluser\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n The most succinct way to describe Code Geass is to call it a cross between Death Note and MEGAS XLR/Gurren Lagann with a generous helping of your average ecchi harem SOL romantic comedy and a dash of Evangelion thrown into the mix. Does it work? Not exactly. Code Geass is one of those shows that brings a lot of good stuff to the table but fucks it up in so many ways once the script comes into question. There are more plot holes here than there are potholes on the Grand Central Parkway, and whether or not that's hyperbole is entirely up for you to\n\n...\n\ndecide. Despite all of this, I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I actually DO happen to like and enjoy both seasons of Code Geass to the point where I would actually go out of my way to have both seasons on DVD or Blu-ray (provided that Funimation actually gives it a release any time soon >_>). With that said, my enjoyment can only go so far.\n\nLet's just start off with what REALLY gets my goat with this show because there's a lot of that stuff that just doesn't sit right with me one way or another. First up, there's the character designs. Believe it or not, the character designs were the very reason why I never bothered watching Code Geass when it was on [adult swim] way back in 2008/2009. Whilst I do happen to like CLAMP's mangas (i.e. X/1999, Chobits), it's their artwork that just doesn't sit right with me. Why am I mentioning this? Well... CLAMP was contracted to do the original character designs for Code Geass and nothing more. I don't know about you, but I'm not too fond of lanky pretty boys with long arms and big eyes, girls with small waists and melons that realistically should make them collapse under their weight, etc. I'm more of a fan of Naoki Urasawa or Inio Asano's artwork than I am CLAMP's from a character design standpoint. Thankfully, not every character on the show is drawn like such (i.e. Charles zi Britannia), but our boys Lelouch and Suzaku are and we see more of them than we see Charles so... yeah. Why can't we have humans that look like regular humans? I don't fucking know, but it is what it is.\n\nThat brings me to another problem I have: fan service. As much as I love my lascivious animated women, the fan service in Code Geass got to a point where I was wondering if I was watching Rosario Vampire again. Any time that there was a serious moment going on where shit was about to go down, in pops Shirley changing into her swimsuit or a shot of Kallen's ass, or Kallen entering a conference room in a bath towel because she wanted to yell at Lelouch, or some other bullshit like that. Yeah... I'm not a huge fan of the girls in this show barring C.C., Cornelia, Euphemia, and a couple of others if only because of the fact that virtually every girl in this show is no better than a fan service character. Would you believe me if I told you the fan service got to a point where there was an out-of-place masturbation scene? Well, there is. When did this show turn into End of Evangelion? I don't know, but that's another story.\n\nGoing off on a tangent, another problem that Code Geass has is the fact that it just loves to jump between all that plot-heavy rebellion stuff with light-hearted slice-of-life school stuff and let's just say that in between the fan service and this crap, I had a hard time deciding which was a bigger buzzkill. As stupid as the actual plot of the show got at some points, it certainly managed to keep me engrossed until the episode ends, I load up the next episode, and I see Suzaku and Lelouch chasing a cat for 20 minutes. I'm not even joking, that was actually the plot for an entire episode. You know, it's moments like these that make me see why the uber elitists here on MAL tout Legend of the Galactic Heroes as a superior alternative to Code Geass. At least that show managed to maintain a consistent tone throughout the entire narrative. Of course, there are a lot of reasons why LOGH isn't high on my priority list, but let's not get into that.\n\nOn the subject of writing, Code Geass has some of the most glaring plot holes that I've ever come across. It took me a while to actually pick up on them since I was too caught up in my own enjoyment to actually bother analysing the show crtically but when you actually use your critical faculties whilst watching this show, you start seeing more and more stuff to use as snark bait. For example, Lelouch's \"Geass\" power is so unbelievably broken (broken as in \"overpowered,\" mind you). He can only issue a command once to any individual, but that command is absolute. Basically, Lelouch has the ability to turn anyone into his slave if he so chooses. Sure, there are some arbitrary rules thrown into the mix as a half-hearted attempt to balance out his powers but really... you have to wonder why Lelouch didn't just order a whole bunch of people to be his slaves until he did something else.\n\nOn the subject of Geass, the way it's handled is just so bizarre. Geass is supposed to be absolute, but shit like sheer willpower and even a kiss from a sexy green-haired chick can override its influence on you depending on what the episode demands (that last one is not a joke; that's how the R2 actually gets going). At one point in R2, there's a \"Geass Canceller\" introduced but it's only given to a character who seems to suffer from a severe case of multiple personality disorder and he only bothers using it whenever he wants to. Now, Geass users are prone to having their powers go rogue and this actually does happen to Lelouch at some point. However, this plot point was quickly dealt with and we never hear from it again. Even if you factor in all the other Geass users, the entire conflict surrounding Code Geass feels meaningless at some points. The entire show could've been condensed to 12-15 episodes had Lelouch actually made better use of his powers and there was less bullshit along the way. Alack, that's another story of what could've been.\n\nSpeaking of Lelouch, the characters here in Code Geass are so variable in terms of quality. Motivations change at the drop of a hat, characters that were once likeable become complete assholes, and even at that point, the writing behind the bulk of these characters just isn't good most of the time. Let's just say this: Lelouch may very well be a genius, but the anime certainly doesn't do a good job of showing any sort of actual intelligence on his part. In fact, Lelouch may very well be the predecessor of Kirito when it comes down to how perfect he apparently is (right down to the harem of girls waiting to drop their panties and bend over; thankfully, Lelouch has no time for these hoes).\n\nThe only indicator we actually have for him being a genius is the fact that he's a chess master and that he somehow has the gift of clairvoyance. Any time some major shit's about to go down, he's able to predict certain events with such a remarkable degree of accuracy to the point where you gotta wonder if Charles and Marianne had Lelouch while a voodoo witch doctor was delivering him. Now, despite his genius status and how he's able to weasel himself out of almost any situation, the guys at Sunrise decided to not make him 100% perfect. He gets cocky and because of this, he makes some REALLY stupid decisions over the course of the show. He ALWAYS ends up letting his emotions get the better of him in battle whenever shit doesn't pan out the way he wants to, he kills off potential allies whilst sparing enemies, and he gets caught up in completely unnecessary battles because of his apparent lack of foresight. Seriously, this guy doesn't seem to understand what back-up plans are and the only reason why he ever makes it out in the first place is because of some \"ingenuity\" on the battlefield.\n\nNow with Lelouch's failings out of the way, let's talk about Suzaku. A lot of people hate him, but I don't. In fact, I'm rather fond of him at some points if only because of his relationship with Lelouch. What I don't particularly like is the fact that Suzaku is apparently trying to change the system from the inside but he ends up becoming a rank-and-file soldier who effectively slaughters his own people despite the fact that he wants to save them. Question: if he really wants to change the system from the inside, why doesn't he become a politician? Okay, maybe there's some kind of Britannian law that prevents Japanese people from getting into politics but the fact still remains that he's so stupid to the point where he fails to realise that he's NOT helping his own people by becoming a person who's contractually obligated to slaughter the Japanese for whatever reason. People rag on him for his idealistic views, but there are a lot of great characters who have idealistic views on whatever (i.e. Kenzo Tenma from Monster) so that alone isn't enough to make him a bad character. If you really want to give him shit, bitch about how he's incapable of realising that he's NOT helping his own cause whatsoever.\n\nThe other characters aren't exactly much to speak of either... at least, in a positive manner. For one thing, there's Nina Einstein... and let's just say that I can't wait to read a fan fiction where she dies a mercilessly brutal death. She has to be one of the most irritating and infuriating characters out there, and she's the one who's responsible for that out-of-place masturbation scene. We have Kallen, whose potential is overshadowed by the size of those melons and that ass of hers. We have C.C. who's quite a hilarious snarker but she's not really good for anything except plot conveniences, fan service, and Pizza Hut product placement. We have Nunnally, an irritating paraplegic who has no use outside of being a damsel-in-distress with a brother complex. There's also a pot-pourri of other characters but I'm not about to waste more of our time talking about them.\n\nFor all the shit I've said about Code Geass in general, the first season on its own was quite entertaining (provided that you don't think too much and just let your inner filthy casual run wild), and it did manage to do some stuff right. For starters, the dynamic between Lelouch, Suzaku, et al was quite lovely and if anything, it's that very relationship that made the ending to the first season that much more intense. The second season on the other hand takes everything I didn't like about the first season and then dials that shit up to 11. We have MORE unlikeable characters (lookin at you, Rolo!), MORE inconsistent characterisation, and MORE disjointed storytelling with all the plot holes you've come to know and love. Oh, and let's not forget the fan service! You know how much I love seeing Kallen's knockers or that sweet ass of hers.\n\nHonestly, the second season is a HUGE drop in quality compared to the first one. Now despite all of that shit I said before, what I really hated about the second season was just how slow it actually was. Say what you will about the first season, but at least it felt like shit was actually progressing from point A to point B. I'm not even joking when I say that I came close to dropping the second season twice because I was so bloody bored out of my mind. Was there stuff happening? Well, yeah but nothing of consequence actually occurs until the final ~6-7 episodes of the season. As strange as it sounds, the second season actually did get off to something of a decent start and it was obvious as to where it wanted to go with the story but it just took so fucking long for ANYTHING of substance to happen. What happened in the meantime you ask? Mecha battles for the sake of having mecha battles, plot twists that would only make sense to someone who's hogging the blunt for too long, and character interactions that just make you wonder if this really was the same show as the first season.\n\nAmazingly enough though, people seem to give this season a pass purely because of that ending. I'm not gonna lie, Code Geass has one of the most intense and ultimately satisfying conclusions of anything I've ever watched. However, that alone isn't enough to excuse all of the bullshit that went on in this season. Yeah, the second season doesn't have as much slice-of-life bullshit as the first season but R2 made up for that deficiency with all of this bad writing. For starters, characterisation is worse here, and I don't even think Sunrise was trying to hide it anymore. For example, we have Lelouch who HATES Rolo because he's not Nunnally and he intends to use Rolo and then kill him once he's outlived his usefulness. However, Rolo ends up kicking the bucket at some point and then apparently, Lelouch loved him like a brother all along even though there was no such interaction that went down between the two which would imply anything of the sort. Suzaku on the other hand ends up doing a complete 180 on his original characterisation. Remember that idealistic idiot who didn't realise he was killing his own people by being a rank-and-file soldier instead of becoming an idealistic politician trying to change the system from within? Well he was all like \"fuck that shit\" and only cares about the end result rather than the means used to achieve them. On the one hand, at least he acknowledges that he was being an idiot but on the other hand, that gets rid of the one trait of his I actually liked.\n\nGoing back to the plot twists, they just really got stupid after a while. I mean, the first season was flawed to high heaven but the plot twists still managed to get me on the edge of my seat until the mood was killed by Bulma, wait I mean Kallen. For example, we find out that Marianne (Lelouch's mother) didn't really die but she was alive all along. Right before she was about to die, she somehow developed a Geass that allowed her to transfer her soul into another body. I'm not making a single word of that up. Can you smell the contrivance anywhere in this whatsoever? Let's not forget how Charles apparently sent Lelouch and Nunnally so that they'd be safe or some bullshit like that (even fans of Code Geass can see the plot holes in this one) or how despite being a racist and cold-hearted jackass for 90% of the show's run, Charles was actually a good guy the entire time. Yeah, I don't buy a single lick of any of this. Oh, and that's not even getting into how Lelouch could apparently control GOD of all things with the sheer power of his own Geass.\n\nYeah, this show is amazing, right? It's so brilliantly written, so gripping and enthralling and it's a master of manipulating your emotions whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat for more! The characters are the best of their kind, and I wait for the day when common literature could even hope to push out characters as brilliant as Lelouch, Suzaku, and Rolo. Oh God, I couldn't type any of of that with a straight face. From a critical standpoint, Code Geass is BAD. There's no two ways around it, it's a bad series in general. This show really knows how to keep it real, real stupid that is. You know what though? All of this stuff combined isn't enough to dampen my enjoyment whatsoever. I mean, for all that Code Geass got wrong, it must've done *something* right along the way. How else could it have gotten so popular in the first place? A lot of the reasons why I enjoy this show are superficial in the first place. The mecha battles were enthralling (by my standards, anyway), Lelouch's hammy behaviour kept my eyes glued to the screen, and the dubbing across both the English and Japanese tracks was absolutely spectacular.\n\nMake no mistake: if you try to take this show seriously, you *will* hate it. The biggest reason why so many people adore Code Geass in the first place is because of the so-called \"rule of cool.\" Code Geass is one of those shows that just oozes awesomeness (well, by my standards anyway) and at some points, it had me cheering on all of the senseless stupidity just like I do whenever I'm watching Gurren Lagann (yeah, it really does get THAT dumb at some points). Code Geass is the functional equivalent of a Michael Bay movie in anime, except it actually gets some more stuff right that Michael Bay would otherwise get wrong. For one thing, it's actually entertaining to watch for a good ~65% of its run as opposed to the gut-wrenchingly appalling pacing that usually makes his movies painful to watch after the first hour (I'm looking at you, Age of Extinction!). Hell, even if you don't find this show cool in the slightest, you'd definitely have a fun time snarking at how stupid it gets. It would be hard NOT to find a reason to enjoy this programme to some marginal degree.\n\nNow where does this leave Code Geass? Well, I'm painfully aware of its shortcomings but that doesn't stop me from enjoying it. For what it's worth, Code Geass isn't a show that's average in the slightest. If it can evoke all kinds of of reactions out of people, it would only make sense for anyone to give this show a shot and see what they'd get out of it. Besides, it's good popcorn material if you're in the mood for something stupid that you can watch with friends while eating pizza. I mean, the uber elitists and hipsters here on MAL would beg to differ but this show ISN'T the worst thing to come out of humanity. That, my friends would be Kodomo no Jikan but that's another review for a different day. Anyway, that's all for now. Feedback is always welcome and with that, I'm out. Peace :)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by defunctmaluser (\n48\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 9, 2009\n\nCredulous\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n There are 95 existing reviews for this over-hyped anime so I don't really expect this review to be long lived and I'm quite happy that it will vanish into nothingness in 24 hours at the most.\n\nI just need to vent some opinions I have about this anime. Did I mention it is over-hyped? Even for fanboys of this anime it must be over-hyped. With a fairly good story it tries to become a mecha version of Death Note and I suppose it succeeds to some extent, but not in a very intriguing manner really. The story has many twists and turns and it is quite\n\n...\n\nentertaining at times, but the story can't save this anime from its characters.\n\nEvery single character of this anime is bad, not even Lelouch is any good most of the time. Mostly because he's so overplayed. However Lelouch is nothing compared to Kurkrurururugi Suzaku. I was on the verge of dropping this anime at each and ever episode, even while watching the very last episode, because of Kurukgukgururui Suzaku, he was not fabulous to say the least. Apart from these two characters the rest of them were no catches either, I don't really feel like going through a list of bad characters so I'm just going to generalize and say they were the usual generic stereotypical blobs on screen fresh from the \"generic steretypical anime character factory\" that they copy and paste into their storyboard.\n\nDid you notice the CLAMP influences? Of course you did, I don't have anything against CLAMP, they've done XXXholic, but really? CLAMP in a shounen? No.\n\nIn conclusion this animes screenplay is an abomination, which leaves character interaction between the incredibly boring characters wanting in such a terrible manner that it drags this entire anime down.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Credulous (\n31\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 18, 2019\n\nxats96\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Take Death note, some V for Vendatta, and some Neon Genesis Evangelion mix it with Fanservice and add Gary stu characters. Boom, You have Code geass! But you have to turn off your Brains before watching it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFirstly about the art and character designs are horrible. They look like shovelled face stickmans. Every character looks like it has been drawn over the same base with hair color and eye color changes. They have no variety or any memorable character design.\n\n.\n\nThe sound and opening/ending are good. Perhaps the only decent thing in this anime.\n\n.\n\nBehold the characters. Lelouch is like a Isekai protagonist...Overpowered, has 3-4 female characters in\n\n...\n\nlove with him, Pretentious smart and basically a Gary Stu who always has a plan to outsmart everyone and has the last laugh always coz he is the main character duh. Nothing spectacular about him, a cheap rippoff of Light Yagami. No complexity, people like him cause he is a badass duh. \n\nHis stupid best friend turned rival is also a bland character. He is boring in short and yes his character design is a copy paste of the MC with minor changes\n\nBut the most useless and bland characters are the female characters of the show. They are just kept for boob shots and to fall for the protagonist. \n\n.\n\n.\n\nYou cant enjoy the show if you want logic and real complex scenarios.\n\n If you enjoy no brainer plots trying to be smart then you can maybe enjoy. This crap is not worth of even 7 overall and its claimed a Masterpiece by some otakus. This is just a Glorified SAO, believe me.\n\n.\n\nThe plot conveniences and stupidity of the antagonist parties is hilarious. And serious rebellion is going on but the government hangouts at high schools. If you want high school ecchi why did you have to introduce a heavy and serious plot/threat first? \n\nWell the first season was just a taste of stupidity, 2nd season is worse.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by xats96 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

I was a powerless corpse pretending to be alive. Living without power, without the ability to change my course, was bound to a slow death.\" -Lelouch Lamperouge\n\nPreface: \n\nI've been debating a review of Code Geass for a while now, and I was really unsure of where to start, given how expansive the story is, and how immense the cast of characters is coupled with everything that I have to say about it. So, that said, this will be a two part review, one for Code Geass part one, and one for R2. \n\nOverview: \n\nLet me first\n\n...\n\ndispel the dismissive \"Code Geass is just Death Note with mechas\" saying: It's totally different. Similarities can be drawn between tons of shows in which supernatural powers are bestowed upon the main characters, along with their aspirations of changing the world. It's a sleight against this show to say that it's just a rip of Death Note, when in fact, they actually premiered the same season. \n\nCode Geass is set very straight up- You've got Lelouch Lamperouge, an exiled member of the royal family of Britannia, out for revenge against his father, Charles, the Emperor of Britannia. Britannia being the greatest military power and empire since the days of Alexander the Great, Lelouch is powerless to take action against this seemingly insurmountable enemy, until a mysterious benefactor, a girl named C2, bestows the \"Power of the King\", otherwise known as Geass upon him, giving him the ability to finally wreak the vengeance he so desperately seeks. His power is one that enables him to give someone he can make eye contact with a single command that they must obey. With this, he's out to change the world.\n\nQuick stuff first:\n\nArt: 7 (5 Animation, 2 Character design)\n\nCLAMP character design, and everything that comes along with it: skeletal bodied characters with enormous eyes and a lot of wild hair designs, but not Yugioh or anything. Sunrise did quite a good job animating this show, though. Juicy explosions, fluid fight scenes, and solid key frames. Character design consistency is very high quality throughout, with no loss of detail at any time. \n\nThe mechas look great, and while many designs are reused for the no-name mechs, the named ones are pure awesome, very unique, and memorable.\n\nSound: 9 (7 for Voice Acting, 2 for OP and ED)\n\nA lot of people really seem to hate the 2nd OP by Jinn, Kaidoku Funou, but I thought it was appropriately energetic for the rising action. The 1st OP and both ED are fine, nothing really interesting, but not worth skipping. \n\nVoice acting is on another level in this show: Johnny Yong Bosch leads an all star cast, with names like Yuri Lowenthal as Suzaku Kururugi, Michelle Ruff as Euphemia, Liam O’Brien as the mad scientist Lloyd Asplund, Crispin Freeman as Jeremiah \"Orange Boy\", the great Megan Hollingshead as Viletta, and the Major herself, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as Cornelia, and others. \n\nProps to Funimation for putting this incredible group of VA together. They really made the show.\n\nCharacters: 7\n\nStory: 8 \n\nIt's difficult to encompass and accurately describe the collective of characters in an ensemble show like Code Geass. Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood has a comparably large cast, who are also very intricately worked into the plot. So many characters make an impact that it'd be impossible to list all of their complex interactions with one another and on the plot itself in this review, so instead of Kicking Logic to the Curb and Doing the Impossible, I'm going to stick with the mains. \n\nTo best understand the characters, we need to first examine their dynamic. Our setup is as described above, a classic revenge tale, Son vs the Father. Lelouch, exiled after the death of his mother, Marianne, at the hands of Charles, flees and lives in secret among the once proud, now subjugated Japanese people, known as \"Elevens\". He and his younger sister Nunnally, who was crippled and blinded after the attack on their mother, are taken in by the family of Suzaku Kururugi, the best friend and ideological opposite of Lelouch. \n\nYears later, Lelouch, in his guise as a bored high school student, gets wrapped up in a terrorist group operating in Area 11, known as the Black Knights, plot to steal a secret weapon away from Britannia. A series of mishaps later, and Lelouch finds out that the weapon is not inanimate, but a green haired, straightjacket wearing witch named C2. Lelouch sets her free, and she grants him a power, the power of Geass- the absolute control of another being, with the rules outlined above. \n\nThe dynamic between Lelouch and Suzaku is definitely the most interesting. As previously stated, they form not just a symbolic Friend/Brother against each other dynamic, but also one of an Anti Hero, Anti Villain. Both make some seriously morally ambiguous choices, both have their tortured past, struggles in the present, but most importantly; their goal for the future. This is what drives their ideological differences.\n\n\"A victory won through detestable means is no victory at all\" - Suzaku in a nutshell.\n\n Suzaku is a hound of the military. He believes that change brought on by violence and conquest is wrong, and that the racist and oppressive Britannian government should be changed from within, his eventual goal to rise to a position of high military power and use it to influence the outcome of the future. Suzaku's strengths lie in his unwavering loyalty to his ideals, and his almost stupidly overpowered/unparalleled strength in combat, particularly that in mechs.\n\n-- (interesting, in that he starts out as a common footsoldier, and is rescued by Lloyd to be a test subject for an experimental mech, which then turns his complete ignorance of mechs into a godly fighting machine. We'll chalk it up to untapped natural talent.)\n\nSuzaku has a tendency to blindly follow his orders, believing it's for the good of his goals, and by proxy, the Japanese- so long as they're at least partly in line with his thoughts. He takes part in many questionable operations, and begins to have self doubt, which really shows the inner conflict in the character. Outwardly, he's always the knight of justice, but inwardly, he has his own darkness, and doubts about whether what he's doing is right or wrong.\n\nSuzaku is easy to hate at the beginning, for being so foolhardy and unflinchingly loyal, uncompromising. However, he shows a true hero's arc, and improves vastly in R2.\n\n\"A life that lives without doing anything is the same as a slow death.\"\n\nLelouch, on the other hand; new powers in hand (eye) is finally equipped to fulfill his dual goals of revenge against his father and his idea of world peace, so that Nunnally can live in a kinder, gentler world. Where they differ is in the methodology. Lelouch plays at rebellion like a game of chess, (symbolism intact). The very image of Zero is that of the king piece in chess, (C2's uniform in R2 is also the image of the queen) and while not the strongest piece, is definitely the most important. Lelouch knows his limitations; namely the physical, and fighting hand to hand. He knows that his intellect and Geass power are his best means of fighting, and uses them to set up and manipulate everyone around him, much to the chagrin of Suzaku. \n\nLelouch may use manipulation, murder, and other detestable methods to achieve his goals, but he's the absolute definition of the Anti Hero. Noble goals taking ambiguously evil or callous means of fulfillment. Despite his cold, calculating Zero personality, or his ever scheming \"normal\" identity, Lelouch has nothing if not a noble goal in mind- everything he's done, his Raison D'etre is his sister, Nunnally. His life is unimportant in the face of making the world a place that his sister can live in without constant fear for her life. \n\nNow, the antagonistic relationship that Lelouch and Suzaku share is as thusly: they serve as foils to each other, the White Knight with the dark past, and the Black King who looks to a bright future. An eternal struggle of brother against brother, friend against friend, and an intense underlying conflict of ideals vs the facade of an outwardly friendly relationship. Cat and Mouse, but who's which?\n\nThe many other characters in the show form a true ensemble, as I said. Screen time is split up very appropriately between the many different threads of the story, keeping parts in suspense when necessary, and most importantly: keeping all the different plotlines up to date where you're not constantly having to keep up with \"What year is this?\" \"Is this the past or present?” For as many subplots as are going on screen in a single episode, Code Geass manages to stay on top of them, keep them relevant, and important to the outcome of the story. The supporting cast has as many scenes as many \"main\" characters from other, lesser shows. They get their fair share of the time, and the story never felt weaker for it. \n\n*Spoilers from here on*\n\nEnjoyment: 6\n\nCode Geass is a very watchable and engaging series, for the most part. It is one of those stories though, that ends up being a jack of all trades and a master of none with how it tries to fit in a lot of themes, with some success and some failure. What I did not like about Code Geass was namely three things: inner universe inconsistency (which I'll get into), tonal inconsistency, and lastly, the fanservice. \n\nCode Geass has a great setup for a gripping plot, and a lot of fodder to work with. It takes its time explaining many concepts, and never felt rushed, at all. However, there are some obvious filler episodes (giant pizza anyone?) and some plotholes (some of which are patched up in R2, but that has no bearing here.)\n\n1. Inner Universe Inconsistency\n\n--The Geass power is explained to have these rules: \n\nA) Can only be used once\n\nB) Eye contact required\n\nC) Person having Geass used on them will perform *to the best of their abilities/physical capabilities the command issued**\n\nD) The order will be carried out as long as dictated\n\nE) The subject loses all memory of actions carried out under the effects of Geass\n\nFinally, F) No one can resist his command, but someone can resist Geass by sheer force of will... (When convenient to the plot)\n\nR2 aside, Rule A stands. Rules B and D are also always true. The issues arise with rules C, E and F.\n\nThe writers played fast and loose with the rules of Geass, bending it to their will when they've written themselves into a corner. Geass comes across as Deus ex Machina in many moments in the first series, and while a cool power, it's sometimes cheapened by its misuse or obvious \"why didn't you just use Geass to do 'x'?\"\n\n2. Tonal Inconsistency\n\n--All throughout Code Geass, we're treated to a lot of different themes and ideologies. This often comes out as a mish mash of conflicting ideas at inopportune moments. There will be a dark war drama going on, with characters dealing with loss of life, regret, ambivalence about the choices they made and how it affects the future, from victorious highs to the crushing blows of defeat, it swings appropriately. However, interspersed with this gritty narrative will be scenes (or entire episodes) of light hearted comedy bordering on a slice of life tangent. We just went from watching people get brutally mowed down by the hundreds to some schoolkids at a festival with a giant pizza mishap. Alternate comedy with some fanservice moments (Kallen, Viletta) and it really breaks up the pacing and more importantly, atmosphere of the show.\n\n3. Fanservice\n\n--Plain and simple, they really beat you over the head with Kallen and Viletta's bodies. Compromising situations, poses, and just really sexually suggestive scenes. I felt they were very unnecessary in an otherwise very serious drama because they didn't add anything to the plot; detracted from it, minorly, because it was harder to take it seriously when they arose during tense and dramatic moments. \n\nOverall: 7\n\nCode Geass was both a real joy and really infuriating to watch. Chalk that up to how it was written, maybe, but overall it's a \"good\" show. This season really amounts to a 10.5 hour long exposition and setup for R2, the more emotionally charged, and consequence-filled half of what's a really great story.\n\n+Great MC\n\n+Good supporting cast\n\n+Very entertaining, keeps you guessing\n\n+Voice Cast is among the best\n\n+Great Anti hero/ Anti villain dynamic\n\n+Detestable villains\n\n+/- couple of filler episodes\n\n- Plot holes (some are not apparent until R2)\n\n- Annoying side characters\n\n- Unnecessary fanservice\n\n- Tonal inconsistency\n\n- Inner universe inconsistency\n\nRecommend? \n\nYes, I would recommend Code Geass. R2 is by far the stronger part, but part 1 is very enjoyable on its own, and necessary to the overarching story.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by lawlmartz (\n120\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 19, 2013\n\nEvillordexdeath\n\nNot Recommended\n\n There are several popular anime whose success is difficult to understand, but perhaps none more so than Code Geass. This anime has been called a masterpiece by various sources, often using such adjectives as \"deep\". This strikes me as a bit odd, because if there's one thing that I think the show lacks, it's intelligence. \n\nThe premise seems reminiscent of Death Note, setting up an allegedly intelligent male high school student against incredible odds while armed with nothing but his wit and an incredibly potent superpower. In the case of Code Geass, however, the power the protagonist is given is too useful and lacking in\n\n...\n\nany particular weaknesses to allow the kind of entertaining intellectual competition that was present in Death Note. Perhaps to try and compensate for this, the series contains several battles between armies of mecha, but the action in these is actually somewhat dull, and they quickly become repetitive and predictable. \n\nThese problems are fairly minor compared to some of Code Geass' other issues though. For one, the characters are archetypical and uninteresting, although that problem becomes more apparent in the next season than in this one. Some of them are quite grating as well, a trait for which Suzaku, one of the most important characters in the series, deserves special mention. The plot is a bigger problem than the characters are. It starts off tolerable enough, with the premise looking like it might deliver an enjoyable conflict between Lelouch and his opposition, but it kind of collapses toward the end of the season. About twenty episodes in, an event occurs that makes it look like there will be an end to all hostilities and Lelouch is unwilling to stop it. This could actually have served as a possible ending to the series, but instead it is resolved with one of the most contrived and nonsensical occurrences I've ever witnessed in anime. The next few episodes seem to waste a bit of time almost, and then it ends with a cliffhanger ending that could also have possibly served as an ending to the series but is also resolved by an utterly nonsensical chain of events that makes several supposedly intelligent characters embarrass themselves so that there can be a second season.\n\nThe art and sound are less worrying. The art style is kind of strange and not visually appealing, but it also isn't terrible. The music is actually somewhat enjoyable and the voice acting is competent. There are a few other things that work somewhat as well. It's kind of enjoyable to watch the fight scenes early on and there are some conflicts that Lelouch gets out of using reasonable tactics rather than something impossible or a deus ex machina. There's a few episodes early on that are fairly solid, and Lelouch is tolerable as a protagonist.\n\nSo that's Code Geass. A poorly written anime with a messy plot and bad characters. Its creators clearly thought that they were more clever than I think they are, and evidently a lot of people agree with them. The bright side is that this season has a few strengths and is certainly not as terrible as the second season is.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Evillordexdeath (\n30\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 25, 2009\n\nSilentMuse\n\nRecommended\n\n Death Note meets Gundam Wing. Nonetheless, the fusion between the two animes can only underestimate the greatness that is Code Geass. Yes, this series is jammed-packed with attractive characters, battle scenes, bloodshed, slight romance, and even a little supernatural dose to add to a stereotypical anime. However, Code Geass - Lelouch of the Rebellion is not as stereotypical as it may seemed at first glance.\n\n~[S T O R Y]~ [9]\n\nInitially, I became attracted to the series through the hyperactive fandom that has spread vastly throughout the world of the internet. Only then did I realize that I could not longer resist watching this show. Indeed,\n\n...\n\nI had my doubts that it would've been a lame rip off of Death Note meets Gundam Wing. Little did I know how wrong I was. A conspiracy between governments, rebellion and anarchy, advanced technology that may be deemed impossible to ever exist in our world, the raw emotion that bounces from one character to another, a small dosage of supernaturality that does little to ruin the storyplot...Code Geass has done well. Breathtaking twists are evident in the series to an extent where the viewer can be grateful that no supernatural assistance was needed. The story flowed as smooth as water. There was not one moment where I felt bored or even regretted watching the series. Even the use of chess metaphors and mythological analogies made the storyplot more interesting. Indeed the show was nothing but a game. Everyone was played. The characters, the world...even the viewers' minds were played! But that was what made Code Geass interesting. It kept us guessing on purpose, like we were part of the game all along!\n\n~[A R T]~ [8]\n\nThe reason why I did not give the Art section the same mark as the other categories was the opening theme. It literally used the same animation profusely except it just switched the order of clips around. Every other manga at least alters the opening theme thoroughly until it does not meet its previous ones. But the opening theme appeared as though it were low-budget, like the creators were procrastinating on changing the opening theme a few times and decided to alter it a little by adding in new clips which introduced new characters we would be acquainted with later on in the series. Other than that, everything else about the art was quite intriguing. The paintings in the museum were a little ostentious but in a nice, presentable manner. The essence of CLAMP was illuminated in the character designs, but it did not change the great appeal of each character's personality. The emotions expressed were drawn well. You could taste the insanity radiating off of Nina's face and the hatred off of Suzaku's face. Well done indeed.\n\n~[S O U N D]~ [9]\n\nThe scores for the anime's soundtrack was fitting for every scene. We could slight feel the suspense, the nostalgia, and even the burning hatred through the music selected on different scenes of the show. The action sounds were not cheesy. The dramatic sounds were ones to not laugh at. Truly the musical scores lived up to the rank I have given them.\n\n~[C H A R A C T E R]~ [9]\n\nIt's understandable how attractive protagonists would surely attract more fans. But I did not fall under Lelouch's apparent spell. Yet I can say that I was bewitched by his hunger for superiority, not to mention locked in the mystery of his past and his intentions. A young, masked vigilante holding the fate of Britannia and Japan in the palm of his hand? It may sound overrated, but his techniques cannot be explained in words. All of the characters left my mind boggled: how do they feel about this situation? what are they going to do? Throughout the series, it felt as though I was able to understand every character and his or her motive. Furthermore, the dramatic scenes displaying the raw emotion reciprocated between different characters was surely not ones to miss. The development was beautifully done. At times even a viewer can sense the vulnerability, the cravings, the sorrow, and the power to know and conquer in each and every character. I applaud with joy.\n\n~[E N J O Y M E N T &amp; O V E R A L L]~ [9]\n\nThis series should not be underestimated. Do not judge a book by its cover here. The only way an anime like this could be altered is through the observation of biased fandoms. Before reading reviews or hearing the opinions of others, be sure to examine the series first before considering anything else. For I assure you reader that, unless you prefer some ecchi delight or dull storylines, you won't be disappointed. This series teaches a valuable lesson: that we live to fight for something, and how we fight gives everyone around us a sense of who we are. So be careful what you fight for, for you will be one's hero and another's enemy. :]\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by SilentMuse (\n7\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 20, 2008\n\nVenneh\n\nRecommended\n\n Title: Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion\n\nManga, Light Novel, Anime: Code Geass has, at this point in time, three manga spin-offs to its name, all being serialized in Kadokawa Shoten magazines. The first, with the same title as the anime (Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion) focuses on Lelouch and more or less follows the series, with art by Majiko!, and began being serialized in Montly Asuka magazine in the Octpober 2006 issue. The second, known as Code Geass: Suzaku of the Counterattack, focuses on Suzaku's part of the story, with art done by Atsuro Yomino, and is being serialized in Beans A\n\n...\n\nmagazine. The third, Code Geass: Knightmare of Nanally, focuses on Nanally's part of the story, with art done by Tomomasa Takuma.\n\nThere is also a series of light novels that follows the series' plot that began serialization in Kadokawa Shoten's Sneaker magazine on April 28th, 2007.\n\nCode Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion is a twenty-five episode series that was produced by Sunrise (famous for their work on the Gundam series and Cowboy Bebop) and directed by Goro Taniguchi (famous for his work on Planetes and s-CRY-ed). It ran on Japanese TV from October 5th, 2006 to July 28th, 2007, and has been licensed Stateside by Bandai. Bandai has yet to release a date for its DVD release, but the dub will be airing on Adult Swim starting on April 26th (next Saturday!).\n\nStory: On August 10th, 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia invaded Japan and conquered the country in less than a month with their mechs, known as Knightmare Frames. Japan, renamed &quot;Area 11&quot;, was colonized, and the Japanese, now known as &quot;Elevens&quot;, were made to live in ghettos while the Britannians live in upper-class walled-off settlements. Lelouch, then ten years old, swears to his friend Suzaku that some day, he will destroy the Britannian empire. \n\nSeven years later, Lelouch is going to school at a private Britannian academy, known as Ashford Acadmey, and Suzaku's joined the Britannian army as an honorary Britannian. One day, Lelouch gets caught up with terrorists escaping with a military secret, and Suzaku is part of the squad sent to capture the terrorists. When Suzaku insists that Lelouch isn't one of the terrorists, he is shot for disobedience, and in the chaos that follows, the military secret is revealed to be a young girl named CC (or C Two), who contracts with Lelouch and gives him a power known as Geass, more specifically, the power to make anyone do anything he says just by looking them in the eyes.\n\nLelouch decides to bring Britannia down using his Geass, while Suzaku decides to attempt to change Britannia from the inside.\n\nThis is a good, solid series. The set up's a bit like Death Note, in which we've got a guy in high school using the powers he's received to change the world (Lelouch), and there's someone opposing him and his ideals (in this case, Suzaku). It's also like V for Vendetta, in that we've got Lelouch leading a rebellion against Britannia as the masked Zero. \n\nThe series ends up being a neat juxtaposition of politics, mech action, plotting, rebellion, and school life. And it's like Toward the Terra, in that a lot of the side characters are developed more than they would be in most series, are pretty intriguing, and end up playing major roles in the plot. The plot progresses pretty nicely, with Lelouch figuring out how his powers work and building up his power and followers and attacks on Britannia, with a few calm-before-the-storm episodes that end up bringing some of the more awesome revelations, plenty of plot twists tossed in, all bought to a boil in the last few episodes, leaving off with that cliff hanger of cliff hangers.\n\nTaniguchi weaves in little homages from the other series he's directed, so if you've seen his other series, watch and see what you can find.\n\nIt's not without it's problems, though.\n\nFirst thing you'll probably notice is the rampant jingoism. It's probably a bit more apparent to me, because I'm in an class about the ethnography of Japan, and we just finished a section on WWII, but, still, you'll notice a lot of BANZAI NIPPON! in the first few episodes. For example, the date that Britannia (which, if you look at the bit before the OP, is, in fact, America) invades Japan is the day that Japan surrendered at the end of WWII. It does get less noticeable as the series goes along, but you can still tell it's there.\n\nThe second fact is that the series brings up a lot of mysteries and doesn't really answer them, a la Rozen Maiden and Romeo and Juliet. But at least they don't try and clumsily resolve things like in Nishi no Yoki Majo or Darker than BLACK. Admittedly, there is a second season that just started airing in Japan about two weeks ago, so hopefully they can address those issues.\n\nArt: The animation for this is really smooth, not to mention vibrantly colored. The action scenes are fully animated, as are the explosions and such, which is nice to see.\n\nYou can tell straight off the bat that Clamp does the character designs because the men are a bit pointy and lanky. But once they're introduced, they get a bit less pointy, which makes the lankiness work out better. And, of course, the females are absolutely beautiful.\n\nSunrise's mech designs do admittedly look a bit like Gundams, and a bit on the bulky side rather than streamlined but, for the mecha I've seen in anime (which, admittedly, isn't that much), they're pretty neat.\n\nThere's some stock footage for when Lelouch uses the Geass, and a bit of recap at the beginning before the OP, but, luckily, it's well-done and doesn't get too old.\n\nMusic: I like the music for this a lot. There are some pretty basic themes and styles for specific people and things that happen, but there end up being a lot of well-done variations. The insert songs that they do don't take away from the scene, but fit in perfectly. \n\nFor the most part, I liked the OPs and EDs for this. The first (and, incidentally, the third ED) and third OP are your standard pop numbers, but they're really catchy. The first ED is an ALI Project song, which, in my opinion, guarantees awesomeness.\n\nHowever, the vocalists for the second OP and ED (whether or not they're the same, I'm not sure) need to be strangled. They're worse than the harpy woman who did the Honey and Clover OPs, and that's saying something. They gave me headaches.\n\nSeiyuu: The seiyuu for this project are made of awesome on several levels. Jun Fukuyama, who played the naive innocent Albert in Gankutsuou, gets to play the scheming jaded Lelouch, and it's particularly nice to see the role reversal there. Kikuko Inoue, who played Mercedes in Gankutsuou, appears in a small, but important, supporting role, as do Jouji Nakata and Fumiko Orikasa. Also, Suzaku's seiyuu may sound familiar, mainly because he's been voicing Cloud in the recent FFVII spinoffs.\n\nThe only seiyuu who really annoyed me was Lloyd's seiyuu, but then again, he's meant to come off as annoying. They did their job there. xD\n\nLength: Had they done some slight reworking of the plot, they probably could have made this a twenty-five episode series. However, the story would've taken a hit if they had. The second season, which, as I mentioned before, just recently started airing, should hopefully bring a sense of completeness to the story.\n\nOverall: A beautifully designed and animated show, with excellent music and seiyuu, and a very solid plot, save for the jingoism and unsolved mysteries, which will hopefully be solved by the next season.\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nArt: 9/10\n\nMusic: 9/10\n\nSeiyuu: 9/10\n\nLength: 8/10\n\nOverall: 43/50; 86% (B )\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Venneh (\n78\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 27, 2015\n\nVisceras\n\nRecommended\n\n I'm here to talk about the both seasons of Code Geass. I don´t want to make 2 reviews about it so i will do as i did with Clannad. \n\nCode Geass .. one of the best rated animes here on MAL .. for sure it deserves it ! \n\nStory: (9/10). It is a complex story, usually or this go terribly wrong, or goes extremely well. It depend if it gets confuse or not. This story starts to be a normal one, but then with some twists we get lost for some time until we figure everything out at the end. The plot is original and\n\n...\n\ncreative. It is about world domination and one of the new colonies named 11 starting a huge rebellion for freedom(and ofc this one it had to be Japan). The leader of the Rebellion is Lelouch, our main character. \n\nI found the plot nice, but this is a progressive anime, gets better with the time. So at the beginning, it may seem boring, and it is but don´t give up, it is worth to watch. Then after the 8th episode, things starts to get hot :D. \n\nThis anime talks about a lot of shit.. really it talks about a lot of themes from love to immortality. From world domination and how is it like to lose our rights as a nation, to what happens when some one gets sick of revenge and power. I can´t tell you more otherwise i would be spoiling but you get the point. It is really interesting to watch this show. \n\nThe story is fluent at some point (when it doesn't get confuse). It is solid and I found no plot holes here. \n\nArt: (8/10). The character design is pretty normal. The characters are solid and have a peculiar shape (all look pretty skinny and tall) and we have really different looks between the characters. The anime is really coloured and the machines (this anime is a mecha anime) are really well designed. The detail is outrageous. The action here gets super nice due to the detail ! \n\nCharacter: (9/10). This is the thing here ! For me the best aspect to see in this anime. We have C2, Lelouch and Suzaku taking the first place as the main characters. While C2 is a mistery until the end, Suzaku and Lelouch have their development since the first episode. While Lelouch suffers a transformation due to his power (geass), Suzaku suffers as well a transformation. He is a japanse who joined the Britannia army(Britannia were the ones who conquered Japan and named it \"11\". So he basically is fighting with his enemy). The anime gets good because of this. The interaction between them 2 and their development is really interesting. They were friends since childhood and now they are like enemys (because Lelouch is the one who is fighting against Britannia while Suzaku is the one who tries to stop the rebellion). So having these 2 main characters makes the plot much more fun rather then just huge machines destroying each other. \n\nThe other characters are pretty as usual as in the other animes. In general, i found them to be really realistic which is rare. But some of them make quetionable choices... he/she would really do that? ~\n\nHere we have everything. Normal characters, super strong ones, super weak ones, and those characters that we just can´t know what they are. If they are bad or good, if they are strong or weak. This gives some kind of mistery around them and it is something that at least for me it was nice. \n\nSo basically, there is a huge variety of characters here, that's why i belive it is the best point here to be considered. \n\nSound: (9/10). We have 2 good openings, while the other 2 suck. But when we have such nice OST no one cares about the openings. Lelouch as a leader of the rebellion, he often makes inspiring speeches and the OST that they use for it it is just epic :D. Not just here, throughout the entire show we see nice OST in pretty much everything. In the romance, in the drama, in the action.. and then we have that finnal OST that almost made me cry :D. So the sound in general has a nice effect on the show, makes it look better. So does what it is suposed to do ( making the scenes better) \n\nEnjoyment: (9/10) I did not give 10 because for me, the 10 would be an anime which all episodes were fun or cool to watch. Such thing does not happens here. As i said, sometimes the plot gets nasty and we can get confused, and the first part of the show is just too boring compared to the rest. But besides that, it make me hooked. The consistent plot twist and the development of the plot was so nice. It also has a nice drama and a litle bit of romance. It is a litle, but it is good !. Plus seeing the huge machines (by they way the are called \"knightmare\") fighting is really epic. Some fights are even better than the fights in some shonens. \n\nThis anime is one of those anime that i will never forget... With this end and this characters, it makes it really unique. Unlike some other animes that can be good but are normal. This one is good and not normal so it becames memorable! \n\nAbout the end? One of the best i've ever seen. It has everything to be a good end. They give an end but at the same time, we can chose our own end and get happy with it. So i think it would be hard for anyone to dislike this anime. \n\nOverall, this anime has everything to be a good anime and that's why it is so known and so well rated. This anime also has a lot of psychological fights so if you liked Death Note you will problably like this one to. If you never saw something like this, well give it a try. It happens that having a super inteligent guy taking controll of an entire army at the age of 17 is really epic xD.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Visceras (\n54\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 4, 2008\n\nNeonToppaTotoro\n\nRecommended\n\n STORY: Code Geass is a story about just/unjust war, the aftermath, peace, and pride. There is great content here with multiple levels of conflict, making the process of deciding right and wrong very difficult. The plot lines are complex, easily drawing the viewer into this fictional world. While the story is not tangibly realistic, the show is quite convincing and alluring. With Code Geass the plot material is serious and demanding. Silliness, fun times, and character development are required and acceptable as long as they remain within the established context. At times the story-telling of Code Geass steps out of its theme, and the flow\n\n...\n\nof the solid story loses impetus and direction in uncharacteristic light-heartedness. The show is then thrust back to its original course which can be jarring. The negative effects of this shift result in a loss of the strong conviction by which the show is driven. Also, this series is not finished, and the end is a huge slam on the brakes. I do not consider the abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion to the 25 episode season to be detrimental, but the end will leave you craving more. Besides the occasional sharp, awkward shift in the plot dialect, the story of Code Geass is fantastic and one of the best of the 2006-2007 season.\n\nART: Sunrise is one the oldest and most reputable animation production companies in Japan, and they have no problems upholding their reputation with Code Geass. Although it's not the best I've ever seen, the animation is very good. At no point is the art direction bad or frown worthy. Mecha fights are convincing enough, dramatic scenes are illustrated well with emotion in mind, and filler scenes don't fall below the established visual standard. The animation is very good, but, more importantly, the animation is consistently good.\n\nSOUND: The voice acting is okay. Some of the voice actors blew me away, especially Suzaku's. Some of the actors left me feeling a little soapy with opera, especially Leuloch's. At times important lines, ones meant to finish a powerful scene with conviction, fall short of their mark. However, the voice acting is situational. Sometimes Leuloch's voice actor convinced me to the fullest. At other times the voice actor made me roll my eyes and laugh. The sound effects are decent, and the music is good at getting the audience interested. However, the soundtrack here does not take command of the epic saga, and there are no moments where the music capitalizes on a scene. The audio aspect of Code Geass is sometimes hit or miss, and the audio is always runner-up to the other facets of the show.\n\nCHARACTER: There are tons of characters in Code Geass, and the show does an exceptional job of trying to involve each and every one of them. Even among the farfetched fantasy of the show, the characters felt unnervingly human and real. Amongst the diverse multitude of characters, there are complex characters being developed through genuine, deep emotions. And then there are the characters who are well developed but not deep. These characters seem out of place like infants among giants. Whenever these normal characters are on screen, the show drops the ball and begins to feel out of place. The screen time was a little too divided between the true characters and the cookie cutter characters. The true characters of the show sold the story and are arguably the strongest element of the show. I just wish they received more time and focus.\n\nENJOYMENT: Code Geass is compelling, complex, and convicting, and the final product leaves your heart pounding with tension and suspense. While the experience is very entertaining and enjoyable, Code Geass is dark. As the characters make decisions with massive consequences, the vast amount of emotional weight of the show can easily affect the viewer. The show is fun to watch and equally difficult to watch. As previously stated in the story section, the show does not do a good job of providing light-heartedness and release from the stress. Thus, the peaceful and happy scenes feel forced and out of place at times. Still, Code Geass is entertaining and involving.\n\nOVERALL: Code Geass is an intelligent and provocative, war-time, think piece. The production has flaws but is still great, and the final product is much greater than the show's parts.\n\nI hope this review has been beneficial. All feedback, critiques, and comments are appreciated and well accepted through messages.

Even though the idea on which the anime based is pretty average and feels like a replica of other series, I assure you that everything about Code Geass is actually more unique and special than you think. \n\nThe simple idea of \"a boy receiving powers and executing revenge\" was taken to new heights in this epic anime. The plot of this series is most likely the most intelligent, unpredictable\n\n...\n\nand fast-paced you'll ever see in your life. Predicting the plot of this anime isn't hard – it's impossible!\n\nIt moves so fast and has so many twists, that at some point you'll surely give up about predicting it and will simply enjoy it. \n\nThe characters in the anime, differently from most famous shonen series like Naruto, feel realistic. Most anime try to offer unique characters with many strange and interesting features. But when you look closely, you should notice that those characters feel unrealistic because they have awfully extreme characteristics, which you won't find in real people. In Code Geass, the characters are much more balanced and feel much more real, while still being very unique and different from each other. Another strong point about characters is their development. You will usually see how different characters deal with though decisions, and may eventually even change the side they are fighting for.\n\nThe animation of the series isn't something I can say much about. Personally, I like it. With that said, it's not my \"perfect\" style of art, and yet I have to admit it's a unique one. Rather than simply being \"good\" or \"bad', I think it's more about your taste. If it fits your taste – you like it, and if it doesn't – you don't. \n\nThe voice acting is really strong, especially for the main character – Lelouch. Since the anime focuses a lot about Lelouch's thoughts and decisions, the voice acting plays an important role in delivering the watcher his feelings and emotions. I think it was done beautifully in this anime. I could really feel how heavy each and every one of his decisions was, as well as how he felt before and after making the decision.\n\nThe music played a very important role as well, and like the voice acting – it fulfilled well its duty. Putting aside the action and tense moments, in which the music was great, I would rather focus on the tragic and dramatic moments. In these very plot-wise important moments, the music was simply perfect. Seeing the same moments without the music will make these moments simply \"another forgetful part of the plot\". But with the music, these very moments will most likely be the ones you'll remember the best after finishing watching the series.\n\nNow, for those who wish to read a more deep analysis about the series...\n\nPlot: The basic idea, which you most likely already read about somewhere, is \"Lelouch receives special power from a mysterious girl, and decides to use it in order destroy the Britannian Empire, both for revenge for his mother's death and to make a peaceful world for his sister\". You will most likely also see similar words over and over when watching the beginning of each episode. It's hard to believe there are many people who read such description and say \"this anime gonna be epic!\". I doubt if there are any at all. And I can't blame them, because it really sounds like a pretty average and simple idea. But the strength of Code Geass isn't hidden in this basic idea, but rather in the way its plot was executed. A basic plot pattern for the idea will be something like this: \"Lelouch and his organization fight against the evil commanders of the Britannian Empire and defeat them. At some point, the evil \"final boss\" arrives and Lelouch defeats him as well. Happy ending. Credits. Bye bye\"\n\nThat's what I believe most people would expect from this anime, and I was no exception. At the beginning, it really feels like it's going to follow this plain pattern. But very soon, after watching a few episodes, you'll realize that Code Geass's plot is nothing as simple as that. To start with, there is no even \"Good vs. Evil\" in this series. You can't simply classify the characters and the different organizations in the series as either \"good\" or \"evil\". If I had to pick, I would rather say that the main character himself is actually \"evil\". But the most important thing about the plot, is that there are many things which make the plot very complicated. The main character, Lelouch, has more to do than just \"fight against the empire\". He also has to make sure he hides his identity, act normally in front of his sister and friends, and most of all – to be a strong and reliable leader in order to make people believe in him and follow his orders. If you think these are trivial matters which has nothing to do with the plot – you are gravely mistaken. Each and every one of them affects the plot strongly at some point, and shows you that the plot won't go the way you thought it will. \n\nThe plot itself is very fast paced. You may not notice this at first, as it feels like things moving a bit slow at the beginning. But once you get to the main parts, you'll be flying trough the episodes, and be warned – you may not be able to stop. For me, the plot was the biggest source of entertainment in this anime. It just keeps on going and never stops to take a break. With each passing episode, my curiosity about \"what will happen next\" only grew bigger and bigger. I'll admit it – I got addicted to the plot of this series, and to the series as a whole.\n\nCharacters: Alongside with the great plot of this series, stands the amazing cast of characters. While the anime focuses a lot on the plot and on moving the story fast, it never forgets about character development. This anime has many characters, like most anime. What makes it different, and better in my opinion, is the balance of the characters. You won't see \"an idiot who shouts the whole day\" or \"a girl which hits everybody when she's angry\" type of characters. Every character has its own unique features, but in the same time they are all \"humans\". Which means that no matter what personality a character has, it'll never act in extreme or unrealistic way. Such balanced characters are easier to understand and to become attached to. \n\nAnother strong aspect of the characters is their \"state of mind\". You often see how different characters must make hard and heavy decisions, which will affect them or their surroundings in different ways. The main focus is on the main character, Lelouch, but many other characters also make important decisions in their life, like Lelouch's childhood friend – Suzaku. Every character has its own past, beliefs, wishes and values. Together, they affect the decisions of the characters, and usually even put them one against another. If you look at the battles in this anime, then you'll see they are mostly based on each person's beliefs. These aren't battles between \"good\" and \"evil\", but rather between what each character \"believes is right\". This adds a lot to the series, and doesn't allow you easily judge a character as \"good\" or \"evil\". Some people may say Lelouch is \"good\", while some may say he's \"evil\". Personally, I belong to the latter type. \n\nBut just like I said – they are humans. Every human sometime loses his way and falls into confusion and despair. You can see it perfectly in this anime. Many characters tend to become confused of what is \"right\" and what is \"wrong\" at some point. One event can totally change the character's personality, and to shake its beliefs and values. Some characters eventually even change the side they support and fight for. Your enemy in the beginning, may end up as your ally in the end and vice versa. If you ask what are the things that make this anime unpredictable, then this, without a doubt, is one of them.\n\nAnimation: Since the character design is done by Clamp, it's not strange to see how similar the art style between Code Geass and Clamp's manga, like X. The characters usually look tall and slim. That's how I always described Clamp's art style, and I think this description pretty much fit Code Geass. I'm a big Clamp fan. Not because of the art style, but because of their great ideas. This art style is pretty much unique to Clamp and you can either like it or not, depends on your own taste. Thus, it's hard for me to say that the art style is either \"good\" or bad\". Even though it's not my \"perfect\" type of art style, I still liked it a lot. I think that in term of quality, this anime was done well – no matter whatever you like the art style or not.\n\nSound: Since the characters are put trough different situation, the voice acting plays a very important role in this anime. If it's done well, then the watcher can understand well how complicated or tense the situations are. If done badly, then everything about the anime will feel shallow and boring. \n\nI say it was done well. Very well.\n\nNotably is Lelouch's voice acting. No matter what the situation was, it was easy to understand it well thanks to the voice acting. Especially when Lelouch was lost or was making hard decisions, I could really understand how difficult and heavy these decisions were. Also, since Lelouch has more than one \"identity\", it was important that he'll feel different in every environment. He really felt like a fearless leader when he was on the battle field, but also as a carefree student when he was at school.\n\nMusic: It's always important to have a great music. Thanks to music, many events become better and more memorable. While the anime had great music during action scenes, I would rather focus on the music during sad and dramatic moments. In these very important moments, the music was perfect, beautiful and irreplaceable. It made those few moments the most memorable ones about the series. Even seeing them again, with this perfect music, will make you enjoy them almost as much as the first time. Without this perfect music, the same scenes just won't feel as great as they did. \n\nEnjoyment: No matter how many things I say I liked about this anime, what really made it my favorite one is: that I really enjoyed it; and to enjoy is the most important, right?\n\nIt almost didn't have any boring parts. It was always active, and was moving forward without taking a break. It was unpredictable to a degree I have never seen before in a series, and I LOVE unpredictable things. Basically, the anime was very thrilling for me. It's like riding a roller coaster – once you start, you can't quit until it ends; but you don't regret it, because every moment was epic and thrilling.\n\nOverall: I recommend this anime to everyone. No matter what you think about it, and no matter whatever you think you won't like it – just try it. I was quite sure myself I won't like it. For me it was \"Robots? Who the hell is going to like an anime with big robots?\"\n\nThat was the reason it took me so much time to actually try this anime. But when I tried, I realized how stupid I was. It doesn't matter whatever there are robots or cliché base idea. What really matters is how well it was done, and how much you enjoyed it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by DarkClaymore (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 6, 2008\n\ndanceljoy\n\nRecommended\n\n Code Geass- Hangyaku no Lelouch is definitely one of my favorites yet I found the most difficult to review because of its complexity. \n\nStory (9/10)\n\nFans' first impression: Gundam + Deathnote= Code Geass. That opinion was normal and may somehow be correct but it is definitely not an acceptable conclusion: the story is a beautiful mix of mecha, school life and epic soap opera. Code Geass may have some familiar elements and some may think \"ah, i know this type\" but when one gets absorbed in the plot; he/she will find a very unique anime with surprising twists:\n\nThe unique thing I find in this series its\n\n...\n\nvery hard to categorize: on the outer surface it is called mecha but the robots and their pilots' endeavors are not mainly the ones that make the story progress, they are just players of the game not the rules. CG is has exciting action scenes but the ones that really thrilled me are the: psychological and tactic's clashes, character development and choices and their interaction with other characters, who the good or bad guy really is and many mysteries being revealed one by one or further mystified.\n\nThe story has lots of irony yet like a fruit salad; different ingredients and tastes good altogether and still distinguishable, the story is very well focused on one point though it has a lot of attributes. An idealistic and righteous but selfish and hypocritical view battles with a realistic, practical but dark and personal goal. In these brain popping thoughts, humor, sarcasm and teenage drama is added together with politics and racial conflict. Here humanism is a tasty ingredient present in every side growing within every tragedy and angst.\n\nArt (9/10)\n\nTechnically, the animation is super consistent, high definition and vivid. The machines are so cool and effects like explosion, sparks and water movements are satisfying. \n\nClamp has made a wonderful job designing the animation. But if one's not fond of thin characters and pretty boys, animation may be not too satisfying.\n\nArt, not only animation, in this series in my opinion is innovative; classic and modern concepts are also used. The one thing noticeable in this series is the outfits; they are post-modern European inspired yet manipulated into pilot suits, uniform(both in military and school) and casual wear into \"anime\" fashion (with Japanese preferences). At first I thought that the \"vampire cape\" and \"mask\" is kinda dorky showing a classic evil and mysterious appearance but I eventually loved it, not to mention the minions' \"evil\" but cool appearance too (which are actually good guys) \n\nSound (8/10)\n\nThough I like some tracks, I was not impressed by the opening and ending themes except \"Colors\". Sometimes they destroyed the mood or annoy me. Nevertheless the background music still give the right mood: Insert songs are well placed and memorable.\n\nCharacter (9/10)\n\nThe characters strongly inspire both love and haterd; some are very unique while some are ordinary. That composition is helpful because too many complex characters will make the plot confusing and unfocused. Though one can say that not all characters are exceptional; their interactions are full of twists and developments! CG featured well some much more complex new tastes in anime characters:\n\n a dark, byronic main character that is insanely smart and good-looking that needs gym classes\n\n a good, kind guy who is the greatest mockery of the concept of heroism\n\n a mysterious, sexy green haired lead heroine that probably knows and understands more things than any of the characters\n\nTheir characters deepens as the series progresses and they are meticulously designed in way that they are both the protagonists and the antagonists of the series, both hero and anti-hero or both villain and anti-villain.\n\nAs for the themes, I personally think that they are action and thrill on the surface,yet deep down, it is back boned in simple human desires, ambitions, frustrations and opinions. Nevertheless, this series is definitely not depressing, not deep as deep as the ocean that ordinary viewers will not even understand the story and I found that it contains weirdness both in humor, drama and tragedy. \n\nEnjoyment, Personal Response and Overall:\n\nI really enjoyed this one, very addictive and offers a lot of mystery. I found the main characters very likable especially Lelouch the main character. I found it really cool.\n\nAlso, this story as a whole is not yet finished, it has a direct sequel: Code Geass r2.\n\nI don't recommend this anime to grade-schoolers because it the story and visual interpretation shows a lot of controversial and violent things and may not answer the question \"What's the moral lesson?\"\n\nOVERALL: 10\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by danceljoy (\n16\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 5, 2015\n\nNuxTaku\n\nRecommended\n\n CODE GEASS IS THE FIRST RECOMMENDATION TO COME TO MIND WHEN RECOMMENDING AN ANIME, ESPECIALLY TO A NOOB, BY PROBABLY ANYONE. To see a spoof on it plz check out my HONEST ANIME TRAILER on Code Geass on YouTube, but only if u watched the series, because there will be spoilers.\n\nin a future, the country Brittania is basically conquering the world and it eventually takes over Japan, treating the Japanese as scum and second class citizens.\n\nThe protagonist is Lelouche, a genius exiled prince with a grudge against the empire who rallies terrorist groups and proceeds to PISS THE F%@K OFF HIS DAD.\n\nThe 2 major characters\n\n...\n\nare: 1) The aforementioned Lelouche & 2) Suzaku the straight arrow who has the same final goal as his best friend/arch enemy Lelouche where the only difference is according to suzaku the end doesn't justify the means, whereas Lelouche disagrees fervently.\n\nCode Geass is a political and strategical masterpiece that EVERYONE would enjoy, the only ones who say they don't like it, are Hype Trolls and can't truly ever be trusted again.\n\nThe more that is said about an anime the less enjoyment and surprise will be given to the eventual viewer so I'll stop here and say that Code Geass is amongst the 10 best anime of all time, not just in my opinion... but it's pretty much a fact, enjoy it :)\n\n(and if u saw it already plz check out my HONEST ANIME TRAILER - CODE GEASS on YouTube)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by NuxTaku (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 15, 2013\n\nobtrice\n\nRecommended\n\n Let me preface this by saying this is the fourth time I've watched Code Geass, and it never fails to impress. I'm also well aware of the many reviews attacking the show for its alleged defects, often going out of their way to tear it apart based upon questionable criticisms instead of offering a sincere assessment on the merits. I can only surmise that the bulk of these are the product of the counterculture phenomenon: the series is so popular and mainstream that it must suck. Obviously I disagree, and I'll do my best to explain why.\n\nCode Geass starts with a great,\n\n...\n\ndeceptively original premise. The world is at war. Its sole superpower, the Holy Britannian Empire, has recently conquered Japan using advanced weaponry known as the Knightmare Frame. Lelouch, a well to do, perpetually aloof boy living in the Tokyo Settlement, escapes his otherwise dull life by beating nobles in high-stake chess games, until the day that he is caught up in a fight between the colonial government and pro-Japanese terrorists, meets a mysterious green-haired girl named C2, and is given the power of Geass (in his case, the power to order anyone to obey his command). War, mechas, and special powers are nothing to sneer at, even if stories incorporating these elements are a dime a dozen. Yet Code Geass stands out in its ability to infuse richness and depth into virtually every element and central character of the story. The war isn't just about land - it's about political philosophy. Britannia, by far the most powerful, nationalist, and aggressive of the world's political powers, is also the most morally deplorable, founded upon racial superiority, economic inequality, and the principle that the strong should devour the weak. The European Union and Chinese Federation, by contrast, choose to grant equal rights or equal wealth to their citizens, but are consequently weak. \n\nNor is Lelouch some random guy who gets special powers and decides to become a terrorist. Besides being one of the best and most complex male protagonists in the last decade, he is an outcast prince of Britannia who despises its philosophy and the Emperor because both deny the worth of his crippled sister Nunnally. Through his alter ego, Zero, he seeks to destroy the world through virtually any means so that he may rebuild it anew. Suzaku, Lelouch's best and yet worst friend and pilot of the invincible Lancelot, isn't just some trite rule follower, either. He is driven by his own dark past to believe that no good can come to oneself or others from an end attained by wicked means. C2 has her own complex history and a soul tempered by an existence outside of time. In her most candid and beautiful moment, she explains that her real name is all she remembers, and so she goes by C2 to ensure that it may only be spoken with tenderness, honesty, and affection. A number of characters beyond the main cast are also remarkably well-developed: Kallen, who leads a double-life as a Britannian student and terrorist and fights to give meaning to her brother's death and mother's life; the deliciously ruthless Cornelia, who presents a formidable challenge to Zero's plans; the maniacal Jeremiah Gottwald, aka Orange Boy, whose devotion to the Crown causes him to lose his very humanity; and Euphemia, the sweetest, kindest, and most tragic character a mecha anime has ever seen. \n\nBeyond incredible, dynamic characters, Code Geass offers a superb story with perfect pacing and an endless supply of suspense and emotion. From the first episode, when Lelouch narrowly escapes death using his newfound Geass powers by ordering the Britannian soldiers to kill themselves, I was completely hooked, and things never let up. While the plot is initially and ultimately about the conflict between the Black Knights and the Britannian government, there are some nice subplots that enrich the main story: Suzaku's rise within the Britannian military and incessant ability to thwart Lelouch's efforts; Shirley's internal struggles; C2's past; the origins of Geass; and the Emperor's obscure plans for the world. Underlying the story are two philosophical questions, one common albeit well executed, the other quite novel - Can revolution be justified if it requires sacrificing the lives and happiness of others (i.e., can the ends justify the means), and if so, who should bear the blame for the consequences? The conclusion is also one of the best of any anime. True, it's the biggest cliffhanger ever and had I been watching during the initial broadcast I would have gone into a fit of rage, but it manages to create one of the most emotional moments I've ever seen, and it ensured viewers would be back for the second season.\n\nFortunately the studio realized it had a great story and went all out on the animation, soundtrack, and voice casting to make this a top-notch production. The character designs in particular are stunning, with facial expressions that often bring them to life (see especially Cornelia when she goes mad). The soundtrack is essentially as good as it gets without hiring Yoko Kanno, featuring a mesh of classical tracks with an imperial flavor (e.g., Noblesse Oblige), beautiful symphonies (e.g., Boyhood), jazzy trumpet pieces (e.g., Pessimistic Time), and a couple of amazing Hitomi tracks (e.g., Stories). The voice cast is essentially as good as it gets (no qualifier), featuring Johnny Yong Bosch (Lelouch) in probably his best performance, Kate Higgins (C2), and an exceptional fit and performance by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (Cornelia). \n\nAlright, so at this point I sound like a fanboy foaming at the mouth, which is partly accurate. But I like to be fair, so I'll close with the few things I did not like about Code Geass. First, and most critically, there are a few times when things line up too perfectly. Eye contact, for instance, is occasionally an area where Lelouch takes a huge gamble and gets lucky. Episode 22 also borders on unbelievable, but is ultimately acceptable because a foundation is established earlier on. Second, events accelerate a bit too much in the final 3 episodes and one more episode would have been nice to spread things out. Finally, I don't like Nina (mainly because of her voice) and I can't stand Tamaki. \n\nObviously those are minor criticisms that had little effect on my opinion of the show, and try as I might, I can't think of any others. Really I'm sure I could add more reasons that I love it, but this review has gone on too long already. Put simply, Code Geass is a masterpiece, and at least for now, it's the gold standard by which I review new anime.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by obtrice (\n23\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 3, 2015\n\nPipluphmv\n\nRecommended\n\n The following is a review for Code Geass Lelouch of the Rebellion as well as it's second season R2. Enjoy!\n\nImportant Notes:\n\n\tBefore we get into the actual review, I believe a quick bit of back story is important. Code Geass was first conceptualized at Sunrise Animation in hopes to create a show that would appeal to a wide range of audiences. The idea originally only entailed a underground resistance leader leading a double life. The idea was then given to the manga author team of Clamp for character designs, (both physical and portions of other aspects as well) a partnership which continued\n\n...\n\nthrough the writing process meaning many of the stories intricacies were also written with assistance from Clamp. The idea was to cover the two largest demographics: Shonen (action and generally story based targeted at young males) and Shojo (relationship based normally set in more everyday scenarios). The question is, were they successful? Well, yes and no. The problem is that if you swap between the main character's everyday life and his secret life at the drop of a hat with little in between, one party is usually unhappy. There are entire episodes based on dating games and creating the world's largest pizza that barely contribute anything to the story. They are immediately followed by two episode long battles in mech suits that get rather monotonous pretty fast. Compare that to a show that, in my experiences, does appeal to almost every audience like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood. Brotherhood keeps the battles much shorter while keeping a ton of relationship and character development, and all of it is integrated together rather seamlessly to have everyone on their toes. Compare that to the separated method which has a tendency to give the viewer minor whip lash. What does save Code Geass is occasional episodes where everything collapses and the two worlds collide pretty beautifully. Now that we have that out of the way, to the story!\n\nStory:\n\n\tCode Geass has an enjoyably complicated story so if you're looking for something to watch while doing other things it might not be the best choice, but hey, a better choice than Baccano! It features very few all out filler episodes, every episode has something that furthers the plot or some amount of character development no matter how small, (except maybe the dating game episode, I can see what was supposed to be character development but... yeah not really). The only real story problem is that at times it seems like it could have ended right there but trust me everything happens for a reason and those who stick with it shall be rewarded eventually. Well that was short, but I don't want to give anything away so let's just move on to characters. \t\n\nCharacters:\n\n\tThe fascinating thing about Code Geass's characters is that none of the \"good guys\" are particularly likeable, yet you grow to care for everyone anyway. Our protagonist, Lalouch Vi Britannia, is a manipulative liar who tells us that the ends always justify the means. Most of his school friends are, in my opinion, annoying, his little sister has a terrible voice and makes me cringe rather than daw, and the only character who acts entirely \"good\" is Suzaku, and he is the one character I didn't really grow to care for! The Britannians on the other hand had several great characters who I loved despite their \"evil\" actions. One thing Code Geass does amazingly well is kill people. Sorry I had to be the one to tell you but you were going to find out eventually and, this is war, come on. By the end you realize that your favorite characters are dead and aren't coming back and you honestly feel the same despair that the surviving characters do. \n\nMusic & Sound:\n\n\tLet's talk music. At the beginning the background music is an awesome flavor of weird. Odd moments in the eyes of the protagonists are highlighted by that sad trumpet. I love that sad trumpet. As the story progresses though sad trumpet leaves us and other than a few quick return visits to say hello and goodbye, doesn't really come back. Other than that the background music is pretty average quality and is made mostly to emphasize the intensity of situations and regality of it all. The opening and closing music varies VASTLY. I loved some of the songs particularly those by FLOW and Ali Project then they are immediately followed by the second opening which I watched several times to be sure I wasn't making a snap decision but no, it's just bad. I'm just going to combine the voice acting section in right here. Decent. Some characters were good. Some were close to great! But some were just bad. Nunnaly is the number one culprit in my opinion. I will never forget her unique and ear-bleeding inducing way of saying \"le-loooosh\" no matter how much I try. On the brighter end though, without too much bias, Luciano Bradley in R2 is one of my favorite Vic Mignogna roles, Johnny Young Bosch does his usual thing for Lelouch which I guess is cool, Euphemia and Cornelia were very fitting, and last actor of mention is Troy Baker as Schnizel which is as amazing and regal as every Troy Baker role. \n\nArt:\n\n\tOkay now just art and a quick conclusion, almost there. The art style is quite unique and was made to mimic the original character designs by Clamp although it takes their drawing style to a new level. Drawing quirks well known from works like Cardcaptor Sakura such as high shoulders, thin bodies, and incredible height, are extended to an odd level that every once in awhile makes you notice: \"Oh yeah, that's super not accurate to life... that's weird. How does that work?\" but it is quite well done and amazing.\n\nConclusion:\n\n\tWell over all Code Geass is very good, it isn't perfect but nothing really is. No matter if you prefer Shonen or Shojo or even if you're more like me and prefer something more moderate and balanced, if you can sit through the parts you don't like, you'll be pleased with the end result. Tears will be shed, trust me on that. I sadly had several deaths accidentally spoiled for me and told myself that I would not cry because I didn't even like that character anyway and then slowly lost my resolve. Well thank you for reading and I hope my opinions were helpful to you. If you can see anything I missed or misreported please let me know.

After adding the country to its territories, it was renamed Area 11, with its citizens dubbed 'Elevens'. Now after all of this, the protagonist, Lelouch, vows to destroy Britannia. 7 years later, he gets caught up in a terrorist attack and the mysterious girl C.C. grants him the power of 'Geass', the ability to make anyone obey your order.\n\n...\n\nUsing that power, Lelouch adopts the identity of Zero -a masked rebel- and sets off to destroy Britannia and free Japan from its clutches, with his primary goal -other than defeating Britannia- being the protection of his little sister, Nunally.\n\nSome people may be skeptical about the art style, but I find it beautiful. The credit for the character design goes to the manga group 'Clamp', I personally never watched or read anything from them, but CG looks marvelous and I have to give them credit for the amazing work that they've done on the characters' designs.\n\nFrom there we get to the sound and music, and I don't really have much to say on this except for, go listen to the first opening. The music of the show does a good job immersing you in the show, through all moments, from an action scene to a flashback to a character death to... pizza?\n\nThe characters vary from 'I'll kill myself if you die' to 'Hurry up and die'. Reasonable Lelouch and retarded (for lack of a better word) Suzaku, Poor table-kun and *cough* PERVERTED, CRAZY, PSYCHO AND OVERLY ATTACHED NINA.\n\nOverall, the enjoyment I got from this show was great, and it's definitely worth your time.

Under Britannian rule, the native Japanese have been subjected to a cruel and oppressive foreign rule. At the heart of the conflict is the protagonist, Lelouch, who is a Britannian prince who hates the Empire. The story begins when he receives a special power from a mysterious girl. \n\nWhat I appreciated most about the story was the moral complexity and ambiguity. Nothing is clear cut and everyone\n\n...\n\n(who survives) undergoes a significant character change. It’s one of those morally grey narratives where it’s hard to tell the good guys from the bad guys. Britannia is an evil empire, yes. I mean they ruthlessly execute Japanese civilians and their soldiers follow orders like Nazis, yet many of the series’ most likeable characters are Britannian students/citizens. The Japanese resistance on the other hand may stand for a noble, underdog cause, but they conduct terroristic bombings and execute Britannian hostages too. Ok, so who’s the “good guy”? If that’s an answer you need to have then this is not the anime for you.\n\nThe story is exciting and engaging and it definitely does a good job combining action with strategy and intrigue. \n\nCharacters 9: It’s rare and great when you have an anime that has exciting and well-developed characters along with a very cool plot. Often you have to choose between one or the other…or neither. Code Geass has both. The characters are complicated and don’t follow typical anime clichés.\n\nOne of the predominant themes that keeps surfacing is the challenge of fighting evil without becoming evil. \n\nI’m reminded of a famous quote from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago (which I was coincidentally reading at the time I watched this anime): \n\n“If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?”\n\n The protagonist, Lelouch, embodies this good/evil dichotomy. He is intelligent, self-righteous, ambitious, vicious and powerful. The viewer can’t help but respect him and his obsessive, driven personality. However, this admiration becomes progressively more uncomfortable for the viewer as Lelouch’s hands become bloodier and bloodier in his quest to eradicate the evil empire of Britannia. Can one fight evil without becoming corrupted? Is it wrong to kill in the name of a righteous cause? Are people guilty by association? What are the dangers of seeing the world in black and white? These are some of the questions that are explored in Lelouch’s journey and (in my humble opinion) allow the anime to transcend just being a cool story and, instead, give it some philosophical depth. \n\nWhile Lelouch is the centerpiece, he is surrounded by very interesting characters too. And while these co-mains and supporting characters serve to give Lelouch more complexity, they are also very interesting and unique in their own right.\n\nFor example, when CC is rude or unreasonable it’s not part of some cutesy tsundere flirtation scheme…no, no, sometimes she can just be a major bitch…which is delightful to watch. Then there’s Suzaku, who I disliked at first for being a one of those over-powered, one-dimensional, annoying, simple-minded, pure-hearted idealists that pop up in anime so frequently, but even he turned out to be more complicated and flawed than I gave him credit for. And of course there’s Shirley, Episode 1: just the cheerful, preppy bimbo; Episode ???— Think again, she’s complicated too. Haha, I guess a good way to sum it up is that everyone in this anime has issues, which makes them interesting. And it’s through these unique characters that we get to see the different facets of Lelouch.\n\nArt 9: the art is beautiful, from the action sequences to the futuristic/Victorian scenery to the characters themselves. The animation takes a very strange approach to depicting the human body. I noticed that most of the characters have very androgynous body frames and are usually tall and oddly slender. In faraway shots people look almost like well-drawn scarecrows. This isn’t good or bad but it’s unique. What’s not unique though is the absolutely shameless product placement. In an alternate universe where Britain rules the world, battles are fought using mechs and where magical powers shape the course of global events, only one thing remains constant…Pizza Hut. That’s right, kids eat Pizza Hut. CC eats it in 90% of the scenes she in and still manages to maintain that slender figure I was talking about earlier. And despite Pizza not even being Japanese or British, Pizza Hut still shows up on buildings, in parties, on desks and even as a password during a crucial moment. I was seriously waiting for the Mechs to start entering battles with NASCAR-style Pizza Hut logos slapped on their guns. \n\nSound 8: Catchy intro but not my favorite. None of the other music stood out in a big way for me.\n\nCritiques: \n\nAt some point, every 17+ anime has to answer the simple question of how wrong is it to kill someone. Compare Elfen Lied and Psycho-Pass. Both are dark shows but Elfen Lied put very little moral weight on the masses of people Lucy slaughtered, and even portrayed her as a misunderstood and sympathetic character. Whereas, in Psycho-Pass, despite a great deal of violence and moral ambiguity, the death of a single anonymous person is still treated as something horrific, evil and thought-provoking. Code Geass is inconsistent and they kind of swing back and forth. Sometimes they’ll explore the psychological effects of a single death on different characters, but other times these same characters kill without so much as an afterthought and go on with their merry lives. I would have preferred more moral consistency. \n\nSatisfaction/Overall 9: I was very satisfied with the first season. I'm looking forward to season 2.\n\nBlood/gore: There is some. It’s not stylized or overdone but they are also not afraid to show death and violence. \n\nLove/Romance: Lelouch develops special connections with a couple of girls throughout the series but the focus isn’t on developing a particular romance. As I said earlier, different characters = different sides of Lelouch and he’s able to interact with each of these girls in a different way. Likewise, these girls each see something different in him. I know it sounds weird but we bypass, a lot (but not all) of the jealousy/love-triangle/harem stuff despite everyone going to the same school. In my opinion, this is largely because these girls see Lelouch’s obsession with achieving his goal (rather than each other) as their greatest rival.\n\nSex/nudity: While there’s a fair amount of fan service in the form of “whoops, I didn’t realize I was naked”, there were a few (usually non-graphic) ‘mature situations’ where I had to ask myself what the fuck did I just hear/see? Seriously Nina, wtf…\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Darkmoq (\n33\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 4, 2015\n\nChrissyKay\n\nRecommended\n\n How many Code Geass reviews are there? I know, way too many. I think I have something a little different to say abut the show though, so bear with me. This functions as a spoiler-free review of both seasons of Code Geass.\n\nI'm a huge Code Geass fan. I've described it before as the crack cocaine of anime because there reached a point where if the series had been the same length as One Piece it would have ruined my life. My first run-through I was truly addicted. Now I'm well aware that the show is wildly popular already. I'm pretty sure I've seen Lelouch Lamprouge\n\n...\n\non more \"favorite character\" lists than anyone else. Any top list without Code Geass will undoubtedly be assaulted by enraged fans demanding why this worldwide phenomenon isn't #1 on everything. It almost seems as though Lelouch has used the power of the king on millions of people worldwide to make them swear undying loyalty to his show. Despite this, the show does take a lot of flack from more scrutinizing critics for its plot contrivances, unexplained magic powers, absurdly over-dramatic characters, ridiculous robot sequences, and the escalation of all of these things in the show's second season. If you're the kind of person that values thematic soundness or plot cohesiveness over all else, that places an emphasis on realism over cartoon mania, feel free to sink your teeth into Code Geass. It's not Utena and it's not Eva: as I see it, Geass has two major goals:\n\n1. To provide insight into the true nature of revolutionary leaders and what it entails to change the world, and to challenge its viewers to pursue an equally grand change.\n\n2. To entertain the fuck out of its viewers.\n\nI'm going to address the first one first. One of the things that makes Code Geass so compelling is Lelouch. Not in the sense that he's fun, though he is that, but in the sense that he is one of the most accurate reflections of the leader of a revolution or similar organization existing in fiction. People like Napoleon or Martin Luther King Jr. or even Ghandi are often drastically simplified by historical texts. People often take one of two sides: they side with the ideals of the person, or the criticize them for not being a perfect reflection of them or having alternative motives. In truth, these people are far more complex than that. Yes, they have ideals, and yes, they pursue them, but they are also human beings: they falter, doubt themselves, lose their way, have personal reasons for wanting to change a larger system. They do not behave in fully one-sided or rational ways, they are inconsistent, flawed, and confused. This is Lelouch. Lelouch breaks down the non-existent boundary between \"everyday people\" and people like Martin Luther King Jr, demonstrating that Lelouch is just as human as they are. Yes, he is an exceptionally intelligent person, but it doesn't take some genetic fluke or divine incarnation to change the world: it takes passion, determination, allies, timing: things that supposedly everyday people can have if they choose to embrace them. Lelouch initially strives to create the ideal world for Nunally, but realizes that he also legitimately wants to change the world because it's what he personally believes in as well. He claims to use people as pawns (such as Rolo) but he constantly demonstrates that he is not emotionally disconnected from them and can even alter his actions to selfishly protect those he cares about. He's neither a saint nor a martyr, and he's not asexual either (Lelouch semi-frequently demonstrates his hormonal urges, and whilst usually able to control them is not always the embodiment of chaste.) Lelouch shows that it takes more than just one brilliant mind to make a difference: all of Lelouch's allies are essential to his cause, furthering the point that just because you aren't Lelouch himself doesn't mean that you can't be an equally important part of the cause. Kallen is a far more talented nightmare pilot than Lelouch, and without her his tactics would be moot in the face of far-too superior forces. Diethard ensures that Lelouch's achievements do not go unnoticed: without publicity, his victories would be of minimal importance. Zero is an idea: he's not a person. The idea is pure, driven, resolute, refined. The people behind the idea are not. As individuals, they are messy, convoluted beings. But together they balance and complement each other and they come together to create the idea.\n\nCode Geass doesn't come up with any solutions to war or oppression or imperialism. From a political science aspect it's a trainwreck and its resolutions are completely unbelievable. But from a people aspect, it's informed and understanding. It's inspiring. It demands more from its audience, asking them how they want to change the world and what they can do to make that happen.\n\nNow, let's move on to part two.\n\nCode Geass is entertaining. What exactly do I mean by that? As far as I see it, there are three main elements that make Code Geass such a huge heap of fun to watch.\n\n#1. THE CHARACTERS\n\nCode Geass has an absolutely enormous cast. In the fifth opening they actually showcase all the ones that aren't dead yet and it takes up an entire chorus. Each and every one of these characters are about as colorful and over-the-top as possible. They're loud, expressive people. They love to give speeches, profess their emotions, espouse their ideals, engage in battles of philosophy, and move/pose in dramatic fashions. From Lelouch to Suzaku to Shirley to Kallen to Lloyd, everyone is memorable. Thanks to this it's an extremely engaging cast since you can remember everyone and a lot about them. These characters are extreme, and it makes them pop like a 3-D picture book. It's more than this, though: despite being absurd, the characters are also actually really good! They all get a lot of screentime, and this is extremely beneficial because we get to see how much most of them make sense: their motivations, their growth, changes, decisions and words all fall into place in a way that is extremely satisfying.\n\n#2. EMOTIONAL RESONANCE\n\nIf there's one thing I hate, it's stories trying to garner emotional investment through tragedy. You shouldn't have to make something horrible happen to your characters in order for me to care about them. Code Geass has plenty of tragedy but never ONCE does it rely on it. It packs an emotional punch because its characters actually grow and change drastically yet subtly, making the viewer feel as though they actually know them. This is because that's what it's like to be around actual people. They grow and change, and you don't always notice it at first but when you look back you realize it. It's because it's so effective at creating this bond between you and the characters that it doesn't need to rely on tragedy. Merely seeing the characters you care about in perilous situations creates intense investment, because the show also proves that it is not unwilling to kill them if that's what makes sense. This is the type of story where you don't care about characters because the die, you fear that they will die in the first place. One of the reasons that this is so effective is because Code Geass has a tangible sense of grounded conflict: there are tangible stakes in each battle, it is understood why the various sides are fighting, and the possibility of a variety of different outcomes feels very real. One thing that will forever stick with me is when a single poorly-timed joke from Lelouch results in Euphemia's horrific demise. It makes the show feel as though it's not glossing over the details: any small moment or decision could legitimately result in drastic repercussions.\n\n#3. THE ABSURDITY\n\nThis is the real kicker. This is where Code Geass truly shines. The show manages to smoothly transition between being completely serious and not seeming to give a f*ck. It's like what Akame Ga Kill was going for, but actually done right. It's not even two sides of the same coin: they're completely entwined. What I mean by absurdity should be pretty obvious: Pizza Hut product placement. Lucrative bombastic speeches by Lelouch. Nonsensical conversations about mech abilities that are never explained (super energy beam cannons! Increase to 200%! Activate the rearview legacy thrusters of doom!). Unexplained magic powers. The fact that no matter what, everything always comes back to the goddamn high school. Entire episodes dedicated to chasing a cat. This works so well because never ONCE does the show have the characters draw attention to it. There's no stupid anime humor. All the characters are always completely serious, and this contrasts against the nonsense of the world they live in PERFECTLY. A lot of people complain about the amount of mech mumbo-jumbo in the second season, but I thought that it fit perfectly. The second season had some of the show's most intense and serious moments, it seems only natural to juxtapose those against a backdrop of INSANITY. What the hell is the 'Mordred' and why does it shoot death lasers from its chest?? Why can all these robots suddenly fly?? Now there's nukes, energy shields, people that can stop time, see the future, and even a collective unconscious. This is like Gurren Lagann, people, except instead of having women as housewives and teachers it has them as nuclear physicists and front-line tanks. This is the kind of over-the-top nonsense I expected from a genre with as much potential as anime, but instead we get dumb slice-of-life shows that think they're funny. Code Geass absolutely nails down fun, often at its own expense, and that's something I completely respect it for.\n\nNow take that surreal absurdity, add emotional attachment and add amazing characters. Hilarious, shocking, creative, fast-paced, tear-inducing, epic, and just the right amount of over the top. That's Code Geass. That's what makes it so much goddamn fun. It's not some pseudo-intellectual nihilistic bullshit like Death Note, it's not idiotic slapstick comedy, it's dumb fun that also knows how to be good. It's both intelligent and stupid, and it absolutely works.\n\nLet's go back for a moment though, to purpose #1.\n\nThis is the part where I have no idea what the creators were intending. This is pure speculation. However, regardless of intentions, Code Geass does something that more shows could definitely aspire to emulate.\n\nIt has an impact.\n\nThrough its addicting nature and emotional staying power, Code Geass might be one of the easiest shows to get obsessed with. It's massively appealing, affecting millions of fans worldwide and permeating their hearts and souls. So naturally, they're going to listen to what it has to say. It's not the most complex message, but it's an important one nonetheless. The main point is, as I discussed earlier, that it has one. Because whatever the message of a show like Code Geass is going to be, people are going to hear it LOUD AND CLEAR. Take Revolutionary Girl Utena, for example. Brilliant commentary on the nature of sexism and social expectations in society, phenomenal use of symbolism, excellent insight into adolescence and the obsession with permanence and eternity created by a fear of death. Virtually non-existent fan base. Due to its repetitive and grinding nature, slow progression, abstract presentation and confusing execution, Utena is only going to reach a very small and dedicated audience. It's not going to make an impact on a wide population, it's not going to turn into any sort of gospel of the masses, it's not going to get its point across to anyone other than a select few. Which is a real shame, because it has a lot of important things to say. But, if Utena had adopted the same tactics as Code Geass: seeking to ENTERTAIN as well as make a point, striving to engage its viewers on a fun, intelligent AND thematic level, I GUARANTEE that we would be looking at a very different reception. That version of Revolutionary Girl Utena COULD bring about the world revolution, because people would listen. Code Geass makes people listen, and then it has something to say. That is the value of entertainment: what can be done with it. That's why I think Code Geass is so great. Because it is entertaining. Because it did manage to entertain me more than any other show to date. And because it was able to do something with that. Sure, the themes are incomplete and basic, but they're also important. Code Geass isn't as refined a revolution as Utena, but it's the one that's more likely to actually happen.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ChrissyKay (\n29\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 28, 2013\n\ndekopinn\n\nRecommended\n\n Code Geass. That's surely an anime most anime watchers have at least heard about. Some consider it amazing and some consider it overrated. But maybe it's a little bit of both?\n\nStory: 9. The story revolves around Lelouch Vi Britannia, an intelligent exiled prince with a sister complex and some daddy issues. In the Code Geass world, Britannia (we all know it's Britain) has taken over 1/3 the world, including Japan, and renaming it Area 11. Lelouch is an exiled prince of Britannia with a dead mother and a crippled sister. He swears vengeance on his father after he banished Lelouch and his little sister, Nunnally\n\n...\n\nto Japan. One day, when caught up in a terrorist attack by some Japanese (Elevens) rebels he meets a mysterious young woman named C.C who grants him a power. Geass, the power of absolute control over anyone (except her lol). With this power and his intellect, he vows to take down Britannia, and create a gentle world where his little sister can be happy. He dons the persona of a masked figure called Zero and manipulates some Japanese into thinking he's doing it to save Japan, while using his Geass and intelligence to win battles against Britannia (though he doesn't win all of them).\n\nNow the universe of Code Geass is quite original, but it doesn't sound that special. Well, the story is not exactly Code Geass's strong point. And for the love of God, it's NOT a Death Note copy.\n\nArt: 8. The art is solid, with CLAMP's lanky characters and pointy chins. Even though I'm not a mecha fan (CG has mecha but it's not a mecha anime like let's say Gundam), I can appreciate the good animation and designs of the robots. Also, animation when the characters are like walking and small stuff like that is pretty great too.\n\nSound:9. Code Geass has a good OST. While most of the OP and ED aren't that memorable the background music that play during the show are usually quite good, from music for sad scenes to battle music. I find myself even personally downloading some of them, such as Deeply Fast.\n\nCharacter: 10. Ah, the characters.... Where do I begin? We have Lelouch Lamperouge (A.K.A Lelouch Vi Britannia) the hero of the show. Er...well, sort of. He's more like the byronic hero actually or the anti-hero. These are typically the reasons people compare him to Light Yagami of Death Note and they're both also highly intelligent, but unlike Light, Lelouch has morals, and a sense of compassion. And even when he does some pretty immoral stuff (like blowing up some soldiers and making it look like suicide) you can't help but cheer for him. It's odd, but there's something so charismatic and charming about him that you just want him to win!\n\nBut surprisingly, Lelouch doesn't overshadow the rest of the cast. You have C.C the mysterious, immortal and sarcastic girl (actually over 500 years old) who gave Lelouch his Geass. Everything she spoke I hung onto her every word. We have Kallen, the kick-ass, fanservice girl in the show, and Nunnally, the crippled little sister you have to feel bad for.\n\nOh wait, I'm forgetting Suzaku, Lelouch's former best friend. Suzaku has very similar goals as Lelouch's, (to stop the oppression of the Elevens and create a better world) but a very different way of going about them. Suzaku and Lelouch are best friends in school, but enemies on the battlefield. Neither of them knows each other's secret identity. While Lelouch leads a group of terrorists named the Black Knights to destroy Britannia, Suzaku (even though he's an Eleven) joins the Britannian Military, and want to change Britannia from within. Oh....idealistic Suzaku. Code Geass has a wide range of characters, most of them interesting and some of them bash-your-brains-out-annoying *cough*Nina*cough*.\n\nEnjoyment: 10, definitely. Code Geass is a wild ride, no doubt about it. Lelouch doing his tricks to score the Japanese several victories, with more plot twists than Evangelion. (But in a good way) It's also quite psychological, and EVERY FREAKING EPISODE ends on a cliffhanger: always leaves you wanting more. But Code Geass isn't without it's flaws...a few questions remain unanswered, and though most of them are answered in the second season, it's still kind of confusing. It's also very faced paced with about 3 storylines going on at the same time, at all times. Personally, I liked this and never found it overwhelming. But it might be different for some.\n\nOverall: Code Geass is a psychological, action, with a bit of romance (and even a bit of politics), thriller. It always leaves you wanting more, and by the conclusion you won't hesitate to start the next season.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by dekopinn (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 13, 2013\n\nIolo\n\nRecommended\n\n Okay first off i want to say that first the only reason I watched this series is because it was recommended to me because I had seen Guilty Crown, and honestly i feel like i have a much higher appreciation for this series because I had watched it.\n\nAlso this review is for both R1 and R2.\n\nAfter watching this series it immediately made it to my number 1 favorite series.\n\nFirst the story, and yes I'm going to try to not hint at any spoilers. This story in a single word would be wow. From the first episode the series never drops the ball. Like i said\n\n...\n\nbefore i had watched Guilty Crown before this so i wasn't really sure what to expect, and when C.C. originally gave him the power of the Geass, I had thought to myself \"that's it?\" but I've never been so wrong. Yes it may not be as cool as Guilty Crown's \"Power of the King\", but the ability to give any order with total obedience couldn't be better fitted then to Lelouch. The series is filled with twists and turns always wanting to watch the next episode. Its a great mix of story and action with the Knightmares. At the end of season 1 you will immediately want to start the 2nd season.\n\nNext the music, this is really the only thing ill gripe about, I feel like there wasn't enough. Really all i can say about this one.\n\nCharacters. This series does an amazing job both with the writing for each character and the voice acting (I've only watched the subbed version). Lelouch is an awesome character. He has so many sides, just when you think you know or understand him, he throws a curve ball and shows you a new side. He can go from cold and calculating, to caring, to off the deep end upset and that's just a normal day for Lelouch. I feel like so many series fall short with screen time between main and supporting characters but this one does it right. Never do you see a relationship spark up and die in the same episode, or random people show up and then are gone the next episode. They start and finish with roughly the same group of characters. Each of the supporting characters get a decent amount of screen time and story around them.\n\nEnjoyment. I've already started to rewatch the series, do i need to say more?\n\nOverall this is now my favorite series. Perfect mix of characters and story. You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll be on the edge of your seat begging for more.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Iolo (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 2, 2022\n\nMaryArts\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n For me personally the story was a drag.

What should hold this story together, are the connections between the characters and the tragic story of Lelouch and his \"friends\". Sadly this is just awful to watch, cause the characters are such a mess and there is no red string anywhere. No one really thinks like a human being and Lelouch is just... an idiot. He doesn't use his powers right and everyone just seems like they have air in their heads. \n\nI just crawled to the\n\n...\n\nfinish line, cause my friend told me how much of a genius Lelouch is... which he isn't...

I don't really know what to say about it. On one side, It has a great story and Art. On the other side, nearly every character is a stereotype and not memorable at all. My biggest problem with Code Geass though, is the way it feels like 3 genres of animé thrown into a blender. Sometimes it's Action/Adventure and stuck to the plot, at other times It goes school comedy and harem. I would not really mind it, though it feels that only 40% of the episodes stick to the plot, and that's sure to annoy you.

Evangelion, for example, is one of my favorite anime of all time. Before watching Code Geass, I was told that it would fall into that same sort of boat and that it would entertain me while making me think simultaneously. While it certainly entertained me and I enjoyed it quite a bit, I would like to make it clear that this is not what I would call an intellectual anime, not even to\n\n...\n\nthe same extent as its oft-compared counterpart \"Death Note\". Let's be honest here; at its core, Code Geass is still a show about giant robots fighting each other in a battle where the biggest and best one wins (*cough, White Knight, *cough). It's overly theatrical, can be pretentious at times, and has a few inconsistencies with its plot… But I still love it for what it is.\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nSynopsis: A boy named Lelouch is secretly the long lost heir to the Holy Brittanian Empire; a planetary superpower who rules over inferior countries with tyranny and an iron fist using advanced robotic technology called \"Knightmares\". Lelouch was exiled from his homeland and sent to live in Japan, which has basically been turned into a Giant ghetto under the rule of the Empire who look down on the Japanese and treat them as sub-human. Lelouch holds a harsh grudge against his father, the King, who exiled him, and so he vows to destroy his father's mighty empire.\n\nHow much you enjoy the story-line of Code Geass really relies on how seriously you take it. To elaborate on that, here is an example of what I mean: In the very first episode, Lelouch receives the power of \"Geass\", a power that allows him to bind anyone to his will and gives him the power to order anyone to do anything he wants. With a power such as that, it is inevitable that a few plot-holes arise. There are a few shortcuts that Lelouch could have taken using his power which he should have been able to figure out since he is portrayed as such a genius, but Geass luckily is able to avoid any show-wrecking plotholes and keeps them all relatively minor.\n\nAnyway, the main strength of Geass' plot is that it simply knows how to get an audience invested in a story; it is written very, very well considering what they were going for. The writers were able to grip the audience from the very first episode and keep them on the edge of their seat for nearly the entire remainder of the show. \n\nCode Geass deserves a lot of credit for focusing far more on the strategy and tactics of mecha battles rather then the fighting itself, which is one of the show's most redeeming qualities. At least, that is the case for the first season. The second season gets away from its roots bit and starts to divulge to the \"Build a better robot! Beat the bad guys using brute force!\" kind of story which is far less interesting. For that reason, I would definitely say that the middle part of season 2 is the worst stretch of the storyline.\n\nHowever, it is certainly worth mentioning that Code Geass has an absolutely fantastic ending. Probably my favorite anime ending of all time. It can only be described using the far overused term, \"epic\". I wouldn't dare spoil it, but I truly wish that other anime would have the balls that Geass has in regards to not being afraid to risks in their storytelling.\n\nSo in conclusion, despite it's minor flaws, the big picture is that Code Geass' plot is impressively written and centered around a fantastic protagonist with supremely entertaining plot twists and an indescribably good ending. If you can look past the minor inconsistencies and the tendency for the show to over-exaggerate (which you should), you will have a blast watching Code Geass.\n\nArt: 8/10\n\nThe characters look great, the settings look great, and the action scenes are very well animated. For an anime released in 2006, these are some very quality visuals.\n\nSound: 8/10\n\nThe OST is definitely the best part about the sound, as it never fails to set the mood. It is used to over exaggerate not-so-exciting scenes a bit too often though. The openings and endings are alright, but none of them really stand out. The voice acting is above average in both the sub and the dub, so you can watch whichever you prefer.\n\nCharacters: 8/10\n\nThe characters in Code Geass are great overall, in my opinion. To the show's credit, they all have very specific traits that make them recognizable and distinct, but Geass can struggle with inconsistent character behavior at times as well as one or two characters that are just very poorly written. But for such a large cast, these things are bound to happen.\n\nLelouch vi Brittania, the protagonist, deserves mention for being a masterfully written, extremely complex character and one of the most notable anti-heroes in all of media; not just anime. You love him at times, you hate him at times, you are constantly intrigued with his motives, and you are always in awe of his actions. Lelouch is compared to Yagami Light from Death Note often because they are both geniuses who are constantly involved in a cat-and-mouse game and because it is unclear whether they are heroes or villains. However, I think the real reason Lelouch is such a fantastic character is the ending to the anime. Everything you didn't understand about him is elucidated, particularly his motivations. It is incredibly hard to decide throughout Code Geass whether Lelouch is a hero or a villain; has he gone mad with power or is he still a force for justice? Well, lets just say the last episode gives you your answer in an EPIC fashion . Lelouch is in the running for my favorite anime character of all time, and I am not alone in that regard.\n\nHowever, for every couple of great Code Geass characters, there is one who is not-so-great. CC , for example, is a character who is shrouded in mystery for a long time. She seems to add a lot to the anime at first with her level of intrigue, her unknown motivations, and her charm, but she receives little to no development at any point in either season, and the little that she does receive is very shoddy. CC is giant wasted opportunity. Don't get me started on Nina either. *shudder\n\nThere are many more great characters to talk about, but I can't possibly go over all of them. In short, there are a few bad characters in Geass and there a few things about the good ones that don't make sense, but the majority of the cast is very, very well done and most importantly; memorable.\n\nOverall: 8/10\n\nIs Code Geass perfect? No, not by any means, but watching it is incredibly fun and you owe it to yourself as an anime fan to watch it all the way through, even if it's just to say that you have and don't like it. I was on the edge of my seat essentially the whole time, the characters were likable, and the story-line is well written for the most part. I highly recommend Code Geass to all ages.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Link_of_Hyrule (\n65\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 13, 2008\n\nCCs_No1_Fanboy\n\nRecommended\n\n Code Geass is easily my favorite anime (that goes for Code Geass R2). It combines the brilliance of Death Note with the mecha action in Gundum. Its basically about a boy, Lelouch, who obtains a sacred power to manipulate people, the Geass. He plans to take over the Britannian Empire.\n\nThe characters are very interesting. For example, CC. The pizza loving green haired heroine of Code Geass. Her past is shrouded in darkness. Her love for pizza adds a lot of humor. CC is easily a fan favorite along w/ Kallen Stadtfeld, the 2nd heroine. Shes tough and is Lelouch's main love interest. Another character of\n\n...\n\ninterest is Suzaku. Suzaku is deeply hated by many for getting in Lelouch's way. He's a japanese boy but joined Britannia to change it from the inside. My fav characters are CC and Kallen.\n\nCode Geass is best watched when all the episodes are released (and they are) due to cliffhangers. Make sure you have nothing to do because from episode 1-25 you'll be hooked.\n\nAs I said, there is mecha combat. Combat takes place in Knightmare frames. Many people believe the mecha genre is over used. Luckily, Code Geass manages to easily balance out mech fights and the stories that happen before each fight.\n\nCode Geass nvr lets me down. The balance of story, combat, and character development.\n\nPeople say Death Note and Code Geass are similar, and they're right. I personally believe Code Geass is dominent. If you liked Death Note, you should like Code Geass.\n\nCode Geass FTW!!!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by CCs_No1_Fanboy (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nPrevious\n - \nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

That’s why its potential is infinite.”\n\nOkabe Rintarou (Steins;Gate)\n\nSuch a powerful quote, from an anime at least just as powerful. It’s one of the many wise quotes featured in the excellent time travelling tale called Steins;Gate. It is a story praised by many, and I think the show is definitely worthy of all its praise: it’s an excellent piece of work. Steins;Gate is, in essence, a unique anime. There’s not a single show that I found to be comparable to Steins;Gate.\n\nBut why does everyone think of Steins;Gate as such a masterpiece?\n\nStory: 10/10\n\nSteins;Gate is about Okabe Rintarou, a “mad scientist”\n\n...\n\nwho spends his time hanging out in his laboratory with his friends Mayuri and Daru. Ocassionally, they manage to invent futuristic gadgets, though these are never worth mentioning. The first few episodes may turn you down, as it seems like your general slice of life/comedy anime. However, when their most interesting invention, the Phone Microwave, turns out to be able to send text messages through time, everything changes: the text messages sent to the past have a huge impact on the present. When Okabe, in a horrifying way, finds out about an evil organization called SERN, and their ways, he is forced to use time travelling methods to prevent from getting captured – and stop their plans. This (around episode 9) is where the amazing Sci-Fi thriller fires up its engines, and puts the viewer on the edge of their seat. What follows is a fascinating (somewhat complex) plot, which manages to blow your mind each episode. Steins;Gate is not just your generic time traveling show; the plot is executed perfectly. Hardly ever before have I encountered such a well thought through plot as featured in Steins;Gate. The show features several jumps in time, but still manages to keep the viewers’ attention without confusing them. The pace present in Steins;Gate is not lacking either – in fact, from episode 9 onwards the show holds a perfect pace. Piece by piece, the mystery of the events that happen is unveiled, working towards a fantastic, satisfying ending. (Which is very rare, especially for a show with such a complex plot) Story - and plot wise, Steins;Gate is pretty much an unprecedented piece of art, and I think it might stay so for a while.\n\nArt: 8/10\n\nThis is the field in which Steins;Gate lacks the most. Steins;Gate isn’t a show with a huge budget, and therefore it is to be expected that the art isn’t jaw-dropping. However, this doesn’t mean that the art is bad, or that the drawing style is unbearable. In fact, the goal of the art is to portray the atmosphere as well as possible – and it does: the art style simply has a way more realistic feel to it than your generic anime.\n\nSound: 8/10\n\nAmazing voice acting, nice opening, and decent BGM. There were quite some moments where I think there could have been made better use of background music, which is why it misses out on a perfect score here. Nonetheless, very solid sound overall.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\n\nWhat can I say, the characterization in this one is just fantastic. The characters are written in such a way that you are bound to like them. They all have their own likeable and recognizable traits, which are perfectly described from the start: Makise Kurisu the tsundere, Daru the nerd, Mayuri the childish girl, and so on. I found myself having a weak spot for Kurisu in no time. There’s hardly any character development, but I think this is not necessarily a bad thing; it would only distract from the fantastic plot that is ahead of the viewer. The only character which, logically so, develops, is Okabe: you’ll find him changing in character over the course of episodes, due to the events that unfold. But this is all for the better: this development is, again, done exceptionally well. The development has a very realistic feeling to it (And so do all the characters in general), which makes the story as a whole even more compelling. \n\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\nSteins;Gate is one of the few shows that manages to score a 10 on enjoyment for me. Like most people, I found Steins;Gate hard to get into, as the first few episodes don’t really cover much ground. However, once the engine got running, I was hooked. I couldn’t refrain myself from watching episode after episode, slowly crawling to the awesome ending ahead. And I think most people would; as the plot is set up in such a way to keep you hooked each episode. If you are a fan of Sci-Fi, then you will surely enjoy this anime – but that’s not a necessity. Steins;Gate is an anime that is very likely to keep you hooked. So go ahead, you won't waste your precious time. In fact, you might want to go back in time to watch it again!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by NyanPls (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 13, 2013\n\nHaiiroTama\n\nRecommended\n\n The subject of time travel is no stranger to the world of anime, so it takes a lot of work to make a time travel story stand out. For Steins;Gate, that hard work paid off. This is by far the best-executed time travel story that I've ever seen in my experience with anime, and if you haven't seen it yet, you're definitely missing out!\n\nStory: 10\n\nThe story revolves around the antics of Rintarou Okabe, a self-proclaimed mad scientist that goes by the alias \"Hououin Kyouma,\" as he essentially dicks around with time and subsequently deals with the consequences of his selfish actions. I'll be completely honest\n\n...\n\nand say that the incredibly slow and random start to the anime threw me off so much that I re-watched the first episode 4 times over the course of 6 months before I could resolve to just pushing onward and finishing the anime. However, this slow start is balanced out by the fast-paced second half. By the end, it was answering questions that I never thought to ask, pointing out the significance of things that had long been discarded by my mind, and that sense of tying up loose ends is just the most refreshing feeling to have after dealing with so many time travel stories that are too lazy to clean up after themselves.\n\nUnlike many time travel stories, especially in the world of anime, Steins;Gate has no noticeable inconsistencies objectively. I say objectively because this is a science fiction story, and that makes it really hard for everyone to agree on it. The thing is, none of us have experienced time travel in the way the characters in these science fiction stories have (and if you have experienced it, I'm very sorry for making assumptions), so there isn't a clear right or wrong way to write a time travel story. Obviously, if a story contradicts itself, something went wrong. But Steins;Gate seems to obey its own rules, and while a lot of people have made very compelling arguments that point out flaws in Steins;Gate's concept of time travel, they all make assumptions about how time travel works, and no one can really say for sure how things would change if we altered the past. \n\nIn the end, this isn't a science textbook, it's a science fiction anime. It's not supposed to be 100% believable, otherwise we wouldn't be able to watch it and say \"wow, that was unbelievable!\" I give the story a 10/10 because it was interesting, well-researched (many ideas are borrowed from other works of science fiction and played with), and overall just plain entertaining. \n\nArt: 8\n\nI really prefer talking about the art of a particularly spectacular-looking anime or else a particularly underwhelming-looking anime. Since the art in Steins;Gate is neither extremely good or extremely bad, I'll rate it an 8/10 for not influencing my opinion of the anime in either direction. Consider it a passing grade, basically where we should expect the art quality of anime to be in this day and age. Anything better would be remarkable.\n\nSound: 9\n\nI can't say much for the soundtrack, but the voice acting is awesome! Okabe's seiyuu is all kinds of talented, but everything good about the sound in this anime, and really, everything good about life in general, can be summed up in the maniacal laugh of Hououin Kyouma. I can't really speak for the English dub, and while I love Michael J. Tatum's work in Baccano, what I've heard of the dub sounds to be sorely lacking compared to the Japanese voices. Miyano Mamoru is just so cool! Sonuvabitch!\n\nOne thing of note about the soundtrack is the lack of one for a large portion of the anime. During quiet moments, rather than listening to quiet music, you're usually just listening to nothing. This is something that I've seen a few times, and I think it's pretty cool. It accentuates the importance of those scenes that do have music, and at the very least creates a nice contrast of mood, not between happy and sad music, but between silence and... not silence.\n\nCharacter: 10\n\nYou should know that while not each and every character is the pinnacle of how great anime characters can be, they're all very interesting, entertaining, and Hououin Kyouma can handle being the pinnacle of just about everything.\n\nBut really, my rule for judging a character to be good is that I either like them or appreciate how much I don't like them. There are characters that I like and characters that I don't like in Steins;Gate, but all of them fit, and none of them are pointless and annoying. And yeah, Okabe is startlingly charismatic, and that can take an anime pretty far in the character department.\n\nEnjoyment: 10\n\nThis anime made me laugh maniacally and cry silently. It also made me think, and it rewarded my thoughts by having closure and clarity, which left me more than satisfied. Easily a 10/10 anime, and now one of my favorites that I've seen!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by HaiiroTama (\n12\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 1, 2013\n\nKuruna\n\nRecommended\n\n As you may have noticed, Steins;Gate is revered as a masterpiece by most. For those of you who haven't had the privilege of watching this show yet, i'm writing this (belated) review to emphasize just how much you're missing out on. \n\nFirst of all, you have to understand that Steins;Gate is completely unique compared to other anime, in terms of story line. Now, with such a complex plot, it would be incredibly easy to mess the series up. Except that they didn't. If they did, it wouldn't a masterpiece. Steins;Gate explores the world of time travelling and time lines, putting in acknowledgements to theories\n\n...\n\nsuch as the butterfly effect and how, once you change a minor thing of the past, the future transitions into one large scrambled egg. Once you pass the first slow starting episodes, the intrigue and mystery begins, and the pace of the series accelerates. The plot throws in numerous surprises and sudden, unexpected turns that, in turn, creates a powerful ending that is almost flawless. Also, you're hit bluntly in the face with quite a lot of feels early on in the series. \n\nOne of the great things about Steins;Gate is that the characters are developed incredibly well. Astonishingly well. To the point that you feel connected with them in terms of their feelings and aims. They each have their quirky side too - not everything is all serious. I'm talking about the mad scientist personality, the Dr.Pepper jokes and Daru's perverted jokes which lightens up the series so that it isn't all serious drama. But the trouble is, the more like able the characters are, the harder you find it to leave them behind when the series ends, meaning that even a week after Steins;Gate ends, you'll probably still be thinking about Okabe whenever you spot a bottle of Dr.Pepper. \n\nI didn't really pay attention much to the soundtrack of the series, i admit, due to the fact that i didn't find it all that enthralling or unique. However, i did enjoy the opening and the ending particularly. Aside from that, the soundtrack did it's job of emphasizing the mood/atmosphere of scenes pretty well. \n\nThe animation in itself was done really well though - i found that the consistency was great, meaning that (to my eye) there was no sudden drops in quality. \n\nSomething that i loved the most was that the ending was fantastic. There were barely any loose threads, and as a poor ending can sometimes ruin a good series, i'm grateful that they executed such a content finale. \n\nI stress that you must watch this series. It's not enough for you to read however many reviews you can lay your eyes on, but to actually experience this masterpiece for yourself. \n\nEl Psy Congroo.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kuruna (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 8, 2015\n\nTehemai\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n Just a horrible anime. This is the anime equivalent of Inception. It tries to disguise itself as being complex and cool when it's really simple and stupid. How it managed to fool so many people into believing it is the former is beyond me.\n\nThe story is just a complete mess. Even the very premise of the anime would not have ever happened had the so called time travel expert followed the very basic concepts you learn from any time travel story. Not to tell everyone about your time machine let alone let people screw around with it. The show basically makes you watch as\n\n...\n\nthe main character repeatedly make this same out of character mistake you've seen 100 times before over and over again until he finds out that doing so screwed up everything up. GASP! What a shocker! He then spends the rest of the series struggling to try and undo everything. \n\nAll the characters are walking over the top anime stereotypes. They can all but summed up in their entirety in about a half dozen words if even. The silent girl that always texts. The he that looks like a she. The moe girl. The computer nerd otaku. The tsundere. That's not oversimplification, there's really not much else to get into about these characters. They are really that shallow. \n\nI'd give it a pass if it was some harem joke anime, but for a story driven anime, this is just unacceptable. The only one that seems to get significant character development is the main character. A mad scientist, which the writer seems to think is a valid excuse to have him do the most out of character ridiculous nonsense all the time. This makes him completely unrelatable which leads you to remotely stop caring about any of what he goes through.\n\nWhile you're struggling to try to piece together all the plot holes, to understand why the time travel expert keeps blabbing about his time machine to every person he meets on the street and to make sense of dumb concepts like how a banana that is somehow reduced to jello but still retains it's shape so you can identify it after traveling through time, don't be fooled. It's not because it's a really deep well thought out story that you're having trouble understanding everything. It's because it's \n\nTUTURU~\n\nShallow and poorly written. 3/10\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Tehemai (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 11, 2015\n\nUsualGuy\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n One word: Hype.\n\nBefore watching this show, i was amazed by it's high scores, big fanbase and critics puting it to a pedestal. I had high expectations and was going into it thinking it would be the second time Jesus would step on earth. But as always, there's nothing worse, than diving into the hype. \n\nWhat else should i say? Steins;Gate has everything a mass consumer needs:a concept about time travel, sci-fi theme coupled with unique characters and....a poorly written story. How did something like this went wrong? I can't imagine, since the production values were high enough to hire a good writer. Not only\n\n...\n\nthe first half of the show, specifically the first 12 episodes do absolutely nothing, and i mean NOTHING. They are painfully boring, painfully slow, painfully killing every good aspect the show initially put into it. After that it gets better, but i didn't have the desire to watch it, because if half of the show is shitty, there's just no helping it. But i still forced myself through the agony. And.... it still didn't pay off in the end.\n\nNow about the characters, they all seem out of this world. I mean an 18 year old guy invents a time machine? Or an 18 year old girl writtes scientific articles, is a research member and somehow she surpasses her own father? and a few other characters also seem unrealistic. The only real character is maybe the owner of the office where the cast was spending most of their time.\n\nOnly the art is good, but even then, the setting is very strange, the sun is somehow to yellowish, i don't know, some colors where too bright.\n\nOverall, i didn't enjoy Steins;Gate as i would have expected. It represents very well the hype that never justifies itself and that Steins;Gate is a second class, no, a third-class show. It is slow, dull and weak.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by UsualGuy (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 6, 2012\n\nMoeKaiser\n\nRecommended\n\n Note that I have not read the visual novel that Steins;Gate is based on. This is a review which judges the anime adaptation by its own merits alone.\n\nOver the last year since the Steins;Gate anime finished airing, the series has garnered massive popularity and acclaim, becoming an internet sensation and skyrocketing to #3 on MAL’s Top Anime page. So, the obvious question is: does it live up to the insane hype? Well, yes and no.\n\nSteins;Gate is a mixed bag of sorts. It has some great concepts behind it, but they often fall short in their execution. The story follows Okabe “Hououin Kyouma” Rintarou, his lab\n\n...\n\nassistants Hashida “Daru” Itaru and Shiina “Mayushii” Mayuri and their encounters with time travel. The story should be familiar to any science-fiction fan, and for the most part stays within the established expectations and norms of the genre, including all the technobabble and repeated recursions of time that one would come to expect. The plot is packed with drama and thrills, and this can make for a very exciting experience for those who just want to sit back and enjoy the ride without sweating the details. However, if you’re a supporter of science or even basic cause and effect, you may find yourself wanting to rip your hair out in frustration at the massive leaps in logic this show makes on a regular basis.\n\nThe series sells itself as a sort of celebration of science; the characters, self-proclaimed mad scientists, are constantly parading around in lab coats, talking about science, using science lingo and bragging about their immeasurable intellect. The problem is that Steins;Gate isn’t nearly as intelligent or “sciencey” as it would like to think it is. The scientific justifications behind the various implausible events which take place throughout the duration of the show range from the laughable to the absurd. They are grounded in some solid scientific principles such as chaos theory and special and general relativity, but whoever dreamt up these explanations is obviously someone whose grasp on these principles is shaky at best. \n\nNow, I’m aware that it’s unreasonable to expect absolute scientific accuracy out of a time travel tale, but the series also violates some more basic principles that you don’t have to be a science geek to understand so much as you just have to think about what you’re watching as you’re watching it. Things such as the butterfly effect and world lines are treated with almost childish simplicity, and one plot thread in particular throws the entire concept of cause and effect out the window in exchange of “fate,” a device which seems extremely out of place in a sci-fi series. There are some unresolved plot threads, and some things that deserve a scientific explanation go by without so much as an attempt at one, which only serves to further damage the show’s image as a “science” anime that it spends so much time trying to build up. It’s things like this that make me wish that, if they weren’t capable of creating a convincing and consistent sci-fi story, the creators would have just gone the magic route instead of wasting so much time with far-fetched pseudoscience explanations.\n\nOn the more emotional side of things than the cold, hard science is the character-driven drama, and in the case of Steins;Gate, it’s this side that outshines the other. The characters themselves, however, leave something to be desired. Although the anime panders to otakus in other ways (the dialogue is peppered with 2ch memes, and the show is not without its fanservice scenes), the area where this is most prevalent is the characters. Daru is the perverted otaku surrogate, with the rest of the main cast neatly filling the role of a different otaku-friendly stereotype. Kurisu plays the blushing, stammering, tsundere-for-everything girl (who wants nothing more than to assure you that it’s not like she’s tsundere or anything), Mayuri the air-headed moe girl with an irritating catchphrase, Ruka the trap whose actual gender is irrelevant given the exception of one particularly ridiculous arc, Moeka the silent, predominantly emotionless girl who communicates solely by texting, and “Faris Nyan Nyan” the flirty catgirl maid who, as you may have guessed from her name, feels obligated to add cat noises into her speech at every opportunity. It wouldn't be such a problem if only one or two of these archetypes were used, but the fact that main cast is made almost entirely up of them seems just a little too convenient. Okabe, as the protagonist, manages to avoid these stereotypes altogether, and as a result he is by far the most interesting and enjoyable to watch out of the main cast.\n\nThe other characters, though stereotypical they may be, are given more depth than the average anime that contains these stereotypes. These characters are each given their own dedicated arc through which their personalities are fleshed out, and these arcs, though somewhat predictable due to the way the second half of the show is structured, are where Steins;Gate excels most. It’s unfortunate, though, that any character development that happens within these arcs is completely undone by the next resetting of time, which makes one romance subplot feel particularly forced and unnatural, something that is half-compensated for with a plot device that should have a scientific justification behind it but slips by without one anyway. The series also feels somewhat empty, as there are very few background characters in the series to accompany the relatively small main cast, and there are even a few instances where the viewer is lead on to think there are more characters than there actually are, only for it to be revealed that the true identities of these characters are actually the same as those of other characters.\n\nThe series makes some attempts at humour to lighten the mood, primarily through the interactions of the characters, which largely consists of arguing, in frequent and large doses. Now, you might expect that people who are brilliant enough scientists to break the very laws upon which modern science is based would be capable of coming up with some rather witty quips, but the banter between the characters is mostly made up of immature name-calling followed by the recipient of the name-calling expressing their distaste for the name which they have just been called. This may be amusing to some, but it got very old very fast for me and I grew tired of it by the second episode. These bouts, however, become less and less frequent as the show progresses and becomes more serious which is definitely a plus.\n\nI’m confused as to whether I should be rating the art or the animation in this review, since the page for writing a review says art while the finished review that other people see says animation. It’s a shame that I can’t rate them separately, but I’ll talk about them both here anyway. Personally, I was not the biggest fan of the character designs as they appeared rather lifeless to me much of the time (I think it was the pale skin tone and white pupils). Many of the characters also suffered from some of the worst cases of noodle limbs since Code Geass, with the obvious exception of Daru, who looked to me like the strange offspring of a barrel and a human. On the other hand, the anime was made with very high production values, and it shows; the proportions of the drawings remain consistent and the animation is smooth, with few hiccups throughout. The backgrounds also look rather nice and detailed, and offer a nice backdrop to the characters and their various antics without distracting attention away from them.\n\nThe music in Steins;Gate is rather good, with some quite memorable background pieces that are placed with appropriate timing to accentuate the different emotions that the various scenes in the show aim to convey. The opening and closing sequences are solid tracks with some rather pretty and high-budget visuals that do a fine job of representing the series, including some hints about the show’s plot dropped here and there. The voice talent in the anime is strong, with Miyano Mamoru’s performance as Okabe in particular standing out. The other performances are somewhat overshadowed by this, but are solid performances nonetheless. I did have some personal hang-ups about the casting though; Daru’s voice (which I was surprised to find out was put on by Seki Tomokazu) was especially hard for me to take seriously during dramatic scenes due to its cartoonish quality.\n\nEnjoyment is probably the area where people’s experiences differ most, as it is the most subjective. Personally, I found my immersion being broken frequently by questionable science and plot holes, which hindered my enjoyment significantly. The humour wasn’t my cup of tea either, but I can see why people find the show as enjoyable as they do. This is doubly true if you’re a non-critical person or are just new to anime in general, a group of people which seems to make up a large chunk of the Steins;Gate fandom as, over the last year, it has become a gateway anime through which many newcomers have been introduced to the medium.\n\nYou might now be under the impression that I hate this anime after reading this review, as it focused more on the negatives than others; however, this is not the case. Although I don’t normally write reviews, I had some issues with this series that I felt were not addressed properly in the reviews that I read (skimming over most of the 10/10 reviews that nearly fill every page) and decided to take it upon myself to put them out there as someone who watched the show after the hype died down quite a bit. If you still have an unquenched desire to read somebody praising this anime unflinchingly, then feel free to check out almost any other review for this series.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MoeKaiser (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 24, 2018\n\nSkielark\n\nNot Recommended\n\n An anime as dull and flat as its colour palette. \n\nWell.. This was the most overhyped piece of trash anime I've seen in my life. Calling it a disappointment would be an understatement. I regret spending all those hours drudging through this dreary, pretentious show. Maybe I'm being overly critical and it's just a matter of it not aging well. After all, a lot of amazing sci-fi has been released since this anime first aired. Movies like Interstellar, Inception, and Edge of Tomorrow, hell even Looper (a movie nobody probably even remembers) all come to mind as having similar elements but being superior in\n\n...\n\nevery way - from plot to character development to the underlying mechanics of time travel they choose to adopt. \n\nSteins gate is a badly disguised harem anime that tries to be whimsical and 'deep', but just comes across as cringey and shallow. The delusional grandiose ramblings of the MC somehow attracts a one dimensional tsundere with daddy issues, an intellectually disabled trumpet, a scantily clothed NEET, a trap shrine maiden, and a neko maid that ends every sentence with \"nyan\". Does anything else even need to be said? \n\nMay as well right? It still can't be as exhausting as watching literally three quarters of this show where..nothing happens. The pacing is horrendous. I wanted to drop it so many times but the cult status and high ratings convinced me that it would be worth it if I stuck it out. No.. No it wasn't. The animation is boring and lacklustre, the sound is.. Wait there was sound? The overarching plot has potential but it's bogged down by its slow pace and unlikeable characters. \n\nThe main character is truly an apt description for this show - an eighteen year old boy masquerading as a mad scientist trying to be more than what he is. As someone who loves the sci-fi genre, I strongly advise you to stay away from this show if you're looking for a cohesive plot, believable time travel mechanics, or characters that don't pander to a virgin weeb's wet dream.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Skielark (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 12, 2013\n\nDeadIEnd\n\nRecommended\n\n Steins;Gate changed my life.\n\nIt completely changed my views about anime, and even life in general.\n\n'How can an anime change your life?' You must be thinking. 'Is he completely mad?' You must be asking.\n\nIf you think the above, this is probably because you simply didn't watch Steins;Gate.\n\nThis review will cover my reasons why you should watch Steins;Gate for those who still did not. It will also hype Steins;Gate through the roof for those who already watched it and want another view about the show.\n\nAlrighty, then. Let's get started.\n\n...\n\nStory: 10\n\nThe story starts out slow, boring and uninteresting, as expected from a story that starts on a small scale. What else can you expect from a story that starts with a small group of friends of a hot summer in Akihabara, in a small cramped place they gather called 'The Future Gadget Laboratory', with nothing flashy, no boobs, no high budget shounen battle scenes? \n\nThe first episode will confuse you, even bore you because of that.\n\n You might even want to say... 'Hey, I'll just drop i-' \n\nSTOP.\n\nDon't. Don't be fooled.\n\n It might start out on a small scale of a simple happy going slice of life anime. But the fact it's no shounen or doesn't have any boobs is plus, and will serve as the form for the great things to come.\n\nYou might even think, 'Episode 2. Boring. Episode 3, Boring. Episode 4 Boring. Episode 5, BORING. Episode 6 Boooring. Now lets just drop i-'\n\nBut after episode 6 is when the things are going to start super entertaining, intriguing and even funny at times with some nice portions of light hearted-ness. The comedy will be funny, the characters will finally start fleshing out, and the story will progress in a steady pace with no filler moments, nothing to distract from fully enjoying a truly good story.\n\nARE YOU STILL NOT ENTERTAINED, going to episode 7 - before the ending of 12?\n\nIf you think like that, then this anime is about to change your life, just like it did for the millions who watched it already.\n\nKeep watching, and be amazed. Keep watching, and thank me for creating this review. Keep watching, and add it to your favorites after that. Keep watching... and be prepared for one of the most epic journey ever done in TV shows, movies, manga, games, in the past, present and even in the future. Nothing might even not come close to the experience that Steins;Gate will offer you. I consider Steins;Gate story to be White Fox, Nitro+ and 5pbs true masterpiece. A true life changing Sci-Fi Thriller about Time traveling and everything that beautifully ties into that concept. I don't want to spoil you the story any further.\n\nArt & Animation: 8\n\nThe weakest point of Steins;Gate, is truly the art & animation, as it isn't a really high budget anime with amazing animation, beautifully drawn boobs or 200 episode long fighting scenes like in your Typical shounen anime. But it takes out the small budget it has, it uses up every single ¥ out of it. The art in the visual novel in which the anime is based on is done by Huke, and is truly the most surrealistic, most atmospheric and most artistic art I have ever had a chance to lay my eyes upon. The fine fellows in White Fox anime studio said: 'HEY, that art is fucking awesome! But we don't have enough yens to fully transcribe it into a TV series with everything moving like it's alive. So lets take a solid take on the art, which will be much less flashy, but will do the trick'. And so they did.\n\nThe final product however, is a bit full of QUALITY in times, and doesn't look really beautiful like in the visual novel.\n\nIt looks like a standard realistic art in anime, and while there are some weird hair colors like in your most anime series, this art still helps fleshing out a believable story.\n\nSound: 9\n\nIn the beginning of the anime, you will mostly hear the sounds of cicadas chirping, with barely any BGMs present, and that's why my score was downgraded from a full 10 to a 9. While it feels atmospheric, it can also bore alot of new watchers who are searching for masterpiece first episodes with bombastic Star-Wars like symphonic soundtrack. Later on, there is much more soundtrack, Done by Abo Takeshi who did the soundtrack for the visual novel too, and by Murakami Jun. The soundtrack is different from the visual novel, while there are some tracks present from there fitting to some scenes. My favorite track is 'Gate of Steiner', which is basically the opening title menu music from the visual novel, but is present at the best shocking and thrilling scenes.\n\nItou Kanako, that I consider as the Goddess of J-pop music after her songs in various Steins;Gate visual novels and ports, has made the opening music, 'Hacking to the Gate'. I think I listened to this track and to the animated OP more than I watched the whole series and read the visual novel, and considering that I rewatched the series many times and the visual novel is about 50 hours+- long, means that I listened to this track alot. A fuck whole lot, even. It's that good.\n\nSakakibara Yui has made the ending song for the anime. The song is a pretty sad track, and is a perfect closure to every single ending of every single episode. So perfectly, it fits like a glove into a human hand. A great choice.\n\nLastly, the SFX are believable in every single scene, and help you feel the tension in the thrilling scenes, laugh your guts out in the funny scenes, cry like a motherfucking wounded animal in the sad scenes. White Fox have them pretty fucking awesome SFX.\n\nCharacters: 11/10 (MAL fault for having a faulty grading score, not me):\n\nOkabe Rintarou (Nicknames: [Self Proclaimed] Mad Scientist, [Self Proclaimed] Hououin Kyouma, Okarin) - \n\nMy favorite protagonist of all times. This dude is like fucking anime Jesus or something (Nope, not Jesus from Saint☆Onii-san). For those who didn't watch Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai!, you might confuse this dude as Schizophrenic, and not as a guy with a simple case of Chuunibyou syndrome.\n\nHe helps carry out the shocking scenes with 100 percent enhancement, and his Chuunibyou personality is so addicting and cool, that I can't help to take out my closed cellphone and say \"OREEEEEEEEEEEE DAAAAAAAAAAAAAA' and \"KIKAN' etc etc.\n\nWhen shit will get realer than real , his mask of the Chuunibyou will break, and his true layers of his caring personality for his friends will show. He will be sad, shocked, everything you'll expect from a protagonist stuck in a Sci-Fi thriller.11/10 Protagonist, right here. I want to be him. Where can I buy some Dr Pepper in my country, BTW? \n\nMakise Kurisu (Nicknames: Christina, Assistant, American Virgin, Perverted Genius Girl , Celeb 17, The Zombie [MAN THATS LIKE 1K NICKNAMES OR SOMETHING]) - \n\nThe main heroine of the series. The best heroine with a tsundere personality, no contest. At the beginning she will act all tsun-tsun, later on when shit gets real, dere-dere. She will help Okabe in the toughest times, and the two will be the perfect combo in them shiny white Lab Coats. 11/10 Heroine.\n\nShiina Mayuri (Nicknames: Mayushii) -\n\nThe mascot of the show who keeps saying Tuturu - and you will too, and a main plot device. No further spoiler allowed, so sorry.\n\nHashida Itaru (Nicknames: Daru, Perverted Gentleman, Super Hakar; Robotics;Notes - DaSH, DaSP) -\n\nA fat super hakar- I mean hacker, that without him the main plot won't even budge and will still stay on a small slice of life scale.\n\nAmane Suzuha (Nicknames: Part-Time Warrior, Suzu) - \n\n;_; (This is probably my third review I'm doing the same description for her, but you can't stop me.)\n\nAkiha Rumiho (Nicknames: Faris Nyan Nyan) -\n\nMoe character that keeps saying Nyan and has cat ears. How perfect can she even get?\n\nKiryuu Moeka (Nicknames: Shining Finger) -\n\nI liked her introvert personality at first, then hated her to death, and then liked her when the story came to a closure. You will do the same.\n\nUrushibara Ruka (Nicknames: Rukako) -\n\nI want to tap that trap (Or is he really a trap even later...?) And I'm perfectly straight. Blame anime for that.\n\nTennouji Nae (Nicknames: Sister Braun [In the visual novel]) - \n\nEven such a small girl minor character like her as her secrets and awesome scenes, some both different in anime and visual novel. Appears in Robotics;Notes as a full grown sexy lady.\n\nTennouji Yuugo (Nicknames: Mr. Braun and another [spoiler to tell]) - \n\nWhere can I buy a braun tube? This old guy's speech later in the story is so fucking awesome. Share his secrets too that unfold later on in the story.\n\nDr. Nakabachi - Oh man. I'll skip talking about this guy, you'll just see.\n\nEnjoyment : 10\n\nNever before have I enjoyed a series like Steins;Gate. It will change your views on anime and life in general, just like myself.\n\nOverall: 10\n\nIt's time to for me to go so I can't write any further. Just.. watch it.

It took me awhile to finish this review, school, other online drama and whatnot. So here is my in depth evaluation/praise of the show Steins;Gate. I must say that I have excluded a lot of spoiling content so that I can have a legitimate review posted. This is my first review and I hope it informs you and gives you a different perspective of the show!\n\nThe genre of Steins;Gate, from what I observed, was Sci-Fi, Thriller, and Drama. The demography reaches out to both Shonen and Seinen crowds. The concepts of time traveling, time paradox, time looping, time leaping, and the butterfly effect were\n\n...\n\nall presented very well. They were explained with a fluent, consistent logic and the concepts are supported by using time lines (in the show they call it world lines, when really it’s almost saying “parallel universe”.) Some may criticize Okabe’s ability to retain his memories through his “Reading Steiner”, which I personally choose to ignore for reasons I will say at the end of the review.\n\nThe setting is in modern day society and the conflict is between our main characters and a secret organization called SERN. The whole SERN conflict shows this kind of Terminator-feel to the overall plot and Okabe is basically John Connor in retrospect to the beloved Terminator series. Overall, the story is greatly supported by the several types of conflicts and plot progression being utilized all throughout the series. Steins;Gate also consists of addicting suspense that supplements the story with a fluent, chain-linked consistency that makes you crawl back for more—a well done job.\n\nCharacters are usually all too static in anime, rather than dynamic such as those you find in some Hollywood produced dramas. Here in this particular series, there is a gold mine of dynamic-range for personality and human-quality. A lot of the characters share this quality and all have some elements that any one person could relate to somehow. \n\nLet’s start with Okabe Rintarou. He is just this loveable, hilarious mad scientist that starts off as a comic relief by acting as a mad conspiracy theorist. There are several attempts in different series that attempt the main character to act as a comic relief; Okabe accomplishes this attempt with ease such as characters from Gintama would capture attention. Albeit, the Engrish and Kurisu jokes could get old for some(I personally never get tired of his Engrish due to the excellent voice acting by Miyamo, Mamoru,) he has his frequent moments where you can’t help but to burst into hysterics. Besides the comic relief, he also has the strongest human quality. He shows a unique dynamic in such a way that nobody would expect: at first he is a seemingly arrogant college student that is a flamboyant conspiracy theorist, then later on he develops many different states of mind and expresses a diverse range of emotion/mood, finally he resets back to his normal self and shows empowerment. Okabe is by far one of the strongest characters I have ever analyzed in an anime title.\n\nAh, a fan favorite: Makise Kurisu. She is as tsundere as they come—in a good way though! The presentation of her tsun side definitely shows the dere in moderation; they definitely kept this cliché at an appropriate level—making her, in my opinion, one of the better tsunderes in the anime world. As a main character, she too has a dynamic personality that develops as well. Even the tsundere part of her personality supplements her character development, like all “dere” types should accomplish. Her dynamic spectrum is unique to the tsundere type: she appears at first to be a stubborn know-it-all, and then they utilize the tsun-tsun personality to such consistency that later on it makes sense that she’d eventually show some weakness. She too later becomes an empowered character and my respect for this is inexpressible. \n\nTuturu~! Mayushi is certainly the clearest example and definition of “cute”. Hit-or-miss, give-or-take, you can’t really get pissed off at her character mainly due to the fact that she can be anybody’s friend at any cost. Being the role of the “childhood friend” of Okabe, she shows an excellent example of exactly what friendship is. She is always so happy and optimistic, and then becomes somewhat of a push over because of her pure maiden self—always too kind to really voice herself unless it was urgent (this exact point here is what drives the plot for half of the series with Okabe.) Lastly, she shows her dedication to keep true to her friendship to motivate a depressed Okabe and return him to his original character with her traits alone. Head-to-toe, inside-and-out, she brings joy to all viewers at some point. \n\nSUPA-HACKA DARU!!! Itaru fills in the role of the typical otaku, with the twist of being a super hacker. He is a fan of another main character Feiris NyanNyan and shows his otaku qualities through his worship of her. The majority of his character is utilized as comic relief. He is, however funny and loveable. Outside of his perverted sense of humor at times, he does express emotional value at times such as: shock, sadness, and even shows constant determination as technician and hacker. \n\nHere we have Suzuha Amane, a fun and high-spirited girl that would never seem to have anything mysterious about her until after the plot develops. Simple words I can say to describe her is that she is a curious character. She is a tomboy in all aspects, she rocks the look and has the swag and cuteness factor to pull it off. She too has her human qualities: she is viewed with this enthusiastic persona, then is an ever so weary and shows threatening body language, then shows the same determination that Daru has, then becomes stressed, and then back to her normal self. Here we start to see a trend of the characters all returning to their normal states…\n\nFeiris NyanNyan~ She is simply the other moe factor alongside Mayushi and plays the role of the ever-so cute neko girl. A fun, energetic, cute, lovable, and playful girl puts the sugar to the spice in this show. Her trend for personality is less dynamic than the rest of the characters: starts off as a cute, playful neko girl, then begins to break down emotionally and falls in love, then returns to normal later on.\n\n“Urushibara Ruka. The mannerisms and voice of a woman... No... More feminine than any woman. But he's a guy. Taller than Mayuri, but so very thin... But he's a guy. Looks great in a miko outfit... But he's a guy. It's already twilight And yet, it's so hot. The cicadas are crying. But... He's a guy.” –Okabe. Okabe pretty much hit the bullseye on Ruka’s entire character—the dangerous bishonen. The moe factor is deceitful, yet so powerfully cute. He is kind, shy and awfully self-conscious overall. There are slight dynamics for Ruka such as playing shy, later sucking up and becoming a bit brave for once, experiences heart break, then follows the trend of returning to normal. A bit flatter than the rest of the characters, but still is a very entertaining character.\n\nMoeka is the last person I wanted to cover, note my sarcasm. She is the fan base’s least favorite due to her involvement in the plot. She plays the role of the popular pretty girl, although it seems as though she acts like a mute… odd combination there for sure. She is easily and reasonably a hate-able character because of her total structure and involvement, just everything about her can give her hate—yet this is why she receives so much attention from the fans. She is interesting; however, that she has this psychological issue from the obvious attachment to her cellular device. Even she can receive love from some fans due to her “emo” part of her. Her human qualities are a bit odd and she could come straight out of an Edgar Allen Poe tale: she comes off as a dandere at first, then turns absolutely insane, then goes back to her dandere self. It’s a bit bland compared to even Ruka, but she receives the right amount of attention anyways from her demograph.\n\nThe character designs are well done, original and very contemporary. The movement and flow of the characters are flawless as well as the background and scenery. The concept illustrations of world lines and such are presented with amazing touch without the use of any computer graphics. Over all ten out of ten for art.\n\nThe voice acting is excellent, emotionally moving, adorable, and unpredictable with the dialogue alone. The emotional drive that comes from the voice actors at certain parts are so well done, that their contribution to the entertainment is one of the key factors of a superb feeling a viewer may get while watching the show.\n\nI noticed that most of the time, the music is either very low or non-existent. I find this to be appropriate for this show and not some cheesy xylophone sounding music during casual moments. During the softer, more melodramatic times they sound a piano piece that utterly captures, raptures your attention and emotion and manipulates the atmosphere and feel of the moment. The score is excellent and consistent.\n\nThe opening song “Hacking to the Gate” by Kanako Itou is an anime masterpiece in of itself. Here’s why I say this: the beats are set at an acceptable tone/volume, the guitars are kept at a constant rhythm that gives a good name to J-Rock for those who are especially unfamiliar to the genre, the vocals are pretty good (the vibrato isn’t heavily used in her voice, her tone and pitch are stunning, and she has a very powerful voice—I think I just became a fan of hers.) The ending song “Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku by Yui Sakakibara” is another appropriate song for this series that starts off with a soft instrumental that should really get you on the tip of your chair, awaiting for something epic. It is a mellow song and interesting at the same time.\n\nFunny how the genre of Steins;Gate is “thriller”; I was thrilled in the sense of utter excitement. My eyes were literally glued to the screen as I, while doing my usual Otakuthon, watched each episode with the suspense one would have when receiving X-Mas presents. There were many moments where I would burst out into laughter, rewinding those parts obnoxiously. There were times where I simply balled out crying, tearing up so much that I had to pause the show in order to finish crying up a river. There were also times that had me blush for how utterly cute and adorable some of the scenes were—be it romantic or moe. Even as a guy, I found a lot of the material awesome.\n\nThere is my full criticism and review of Steins;Gate. I gave it a ten-out-of-ten status mostly because of the emotional roller coaster I had with it. It isn’t about “how believable” an anime may be no matter how close to reality it is trying to resemble. We all watch and seek entertainment simply to be entertained. Albeit there are many, upon many things that needs criticism. I just didn’t feel that this particular show deserved hardly any criticism, so my overflowing hormones force me to over look some of these in-depth details. Can’t wait for the specials and many more things to come along from this series! El. Psy.

Why because there is to many things that can go wrong and once something is changed you need to keep that paradox or the change could never have happened.\n\nThis show handles that correctly. \n\n...\n\nThe plot is pretty good not completely original but done well.\n\nThe art and sound are fine.\n\nI guess its time for the negatives\n\nIt has a slow start. I know you can't judge just on how things start but I should not have to watch 4 hours of something before I get into something. It just doesn't connect with the viewer, to make them feel like they should keep watching. The reason why I kept watching is that I was curious, to know why people love it so much. That is not a good reason, its my reason but not a good one.\n\nThat leads to my second point the show drags, and trust me it drags out everything or nearly everything. It does not like to get the point it wants to keep you thinking. Some people might call this creative writing, doing this sometimes is creative, doing this all the time is Dragon Ball Z Fight scenes.\n\nThere is a episode if I remember right where it is just the same thing over and over and over.\n\nCharacters this one is a little bit more personal obviously.\n\nThe Protestant is uninteresting, he is boring, he is ridiculous, and I don't understand him. In saying that the other characters are more interesting but still a little bland. A pervert, A kindhearted unintelligent girl, a genius, a mystery none talker, a what should be a girl, and an energetic girl. \n\nEven though the characters themselves are not all to interesting the relationships with each other can be. There back stories are OK somewhat generic, so not all that great.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by PoisonedTea (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 13, 2011\n\nSamu-tan\n\nRecommended\n\n Steins;Gate. One of the most popular visual novels of 2009. When I first heard it would get an anime adaptation, I was both psyched and worried. We all know VN to anime adaptations don’t work out that well most (read: almost ALL) of the time, and we all know that ChäoS;HEAd’s anime was absolutely terrible, especially if you compare it to the obviously superior source material, but even because of all this I was incredibly hyped for it. I had only heard great things about the VN, and I was getting my hopes up really high. \n\nI didn’t want to get them too that high\n\n...\n\nthough, because I was bound to get disappointed, right? Right?!\n\nWell, guess what. I didn’t.\n\nSteins;Gate is an absolute masterpiece. The first episode is incredibly confusing, and the rest is some light-hearted story about a group of friends developing a microwave that is able to send text messages to the past. The story does get more dark and thrilling along the way, and when you're half way into the show, shit gets real. As in seriously, it gets effing real. \n\nSteins;Gate then turns into a science-fiction thriller with twists and turns that almost every viewer did not see coming. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and almost every episode ends with a certain cliffhanger, which made watching this show while it aired extremely painful, but also an amazing experience. The story is very good, and the plot development has great pacing; it is neither rushed, nor slow. \n\nThe show’s characters are great. They’re all loveable, and almost all the supporting characters get 1 or 2 episodes dedicated to them, which develop them more than most of the supporting characters of other shows. And what’s even funnier, almost all of the female characters are kind of stereotypical. We have the tsundere, the cutesy maid, the childhood friend, the silent and shy one and we even have a trap! And I can tell you, that all of these characters are absolutely great. We all hate the stereotypes that IS: Infinite Stratos and almost all of JC Staff’s latest crappy anime give us, but guess what. These girls are amazing. I started watching the series with not really liking everyone, but I ended this series with loving almost every character. They’re beautifully written, have great personalities, and they all end up way less stereotypical than you’d think they were at first. There just isn’t a single thing that you can hate about them. It’s like the complete opposite of School Days’ characters. \n\nBut the absolute star has to be our “MAD SCIENTIST” Okabe Rintarou. His personality is great, and he isn’t like every single other anime’s male main character: he isn’t dense, he isn’t afraid of girls and he doesn’t take shit from anyone. I mean, hell, how long has it been since we’ve had a guy like this? \n\nAlong with Steins;Gate’s awesome characters, we have beautiful performances of very talented seiyuu. We all know Miyano Mamoru is a great seiyuu, but his performance for Okabe has to be one of his most amazing ones to date. Miyano and his superb voice for Okabe will leave you laughing for several minutes multiple times. Imai Isami plays the tsundere for Steins;Gate, and she’s fairly good at it. She has a nice voice, even when she’s mad, but it’s better when she’s being kind. Hanazawa Kana does a great job at portraying the seemingly brainless Shiina Mayuri, but I have to admit, I’m kind of getting sick of this voice of her. I prefer she’d do some different roles now and then, like she did in Kannagi.\n\nKobayashi Yuu gives an outstanding performance as the show’s trap, but we’re used to that. Her ambiguous voice does its job once again. And Tamura Yukari definitely deserves an honorable mention, since she has delivered an absolutely amazing performance as Amane Suzuha. During one of the episodes, she expressed so much emotion, that I got all teary-eyed. I mean, I shed some manly tears. \n\nSteins;Gate’s soundtrack is nice, it fits the situations perfectly. It excels at giving amazing background music at the show’s most suspenseful scenes, and I’m sure it’d be a lot less enjoyable without it. \n\nThe bad thing about Steins;Gate is its sound effects. They sound INCREDIBLY dated, it’s like White Fox cut them straight out of a 90’s anime and just pasted them at the last moment using Windows Movie Maker. The most simple sound effects were horrible, like hitting someone or smashing a door. This annoyed me at times, but it didn’t take away any of the enjoyment this show has given me. \n\nAnd now, the show’s opening. I’m an avid Itou Kanako fan, so you probably could’ve imagined that I went rabid when I heard the show’s opening theme song. It’s amazing. I can’t stop listening to it. And the opening animation fits the song perfectly. Props to the person that directed the opening, it’s a great start to an amazing episode of a superb anime.\n\nThe ending theme song, sung by Sakakibara Yui, who also voiced FES in ChäoS;HEAd which is also a singer in that anime/VN, fits the anime perfectly, whether it ended happily, with a cliffhanger or with something incredibly sad. \n\nThe animation was, sadly, disappointing. Especially after 5pb’s producer told us through twitter that Steins;Gate would feature movie-like animation. Some of the scenes are beautifully animated, but when a scene has zoomed out characters, they’re drawn very ugly and you just can’t refrain from pointing out the errors and laughing at them. It also features awkward zooms on the characters’ faces at times, which do work out most of the time, but sometimes it just looks plain bad. The anime also has dark and grey backgrounds, which feature no life at all and are mostly boring to look at. But well, that was expectable, since most of the anime takes place in a small room.\n\nI know that I’m only naming the bad things right now, but Steins;Gate’s animation is pretty good. Let’s just say it works most of the time, and some of the scenes feature a peculiar style of art, animation and camera angles which look great.\n\nSteins;Gate’s original character designs were handled by Huke, and he did a great job with it. It’s a pity that the anime production staff decided to not keep the VN’s original art choice, but it’s would’ve been difficult to adapt that in a moving animation, so I do understand their choice. I do wish that they had kept the VN’s eye designs, since they were beautiful. And I thought they kept it too, after looking at several promotional images of the anime and seeing that they featured the VN’s awesome eye designs. Sadly, they weren’t there in the anime adaptation. But now I’m just nitpicking again.\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nSteins;Gate is a suspenseful ride that you will not forget any time soon after you’ve finished watching it. It is so incredibly thrilling and it has so many plot twists and mind blowing events, that you’ll hold your breath or scream at the screen multiple times. It features amazing voice acting performances by talented seiyuu and a great soundtrack, including the opening and the ending. You will end up loving all of this show’s characters, since they all of their own charm and they’re all incredibly likeable. \n\nThe animation is fairly good, and the sound effects are incredibly dated, but don’t let that scare you off. Steins;Gate is a masterpiece. It will twist your emotions in multiple ways loads of times. It’s an absolute must-watch, and it’s definitely one of THE best thrillers in the history of anime. \n\nSTORY = 10\n\nART/ANIMATION = 7\n\nMUSIC/VOICE ACTING/SFX = 9\n\nCHARACTERS = 10\n\nENJOYMENT = 10\n\nOVERALL SCORE = (STORYx2 + ART + SOUND + CHARx2 + ENJOYx3)/9 = 9,55556 = 10\n\nFinal score for Steins;Gate = 10/10 (ABSOLUTE MASTERPIECE)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Samu-tan (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 15, 2011\n\nKatayokuTsuneki\n\nRecommended\n\n Let me start with some back story and then the actual review will follow.\n\nAbout four years ago two Japanese video game companies, Nitroplus and 5pb., started a collaboration to make the world a better place with some neat visual novels. The first project came out of it was ChäoS;HEAd with its scenario written by Hayashi Naotaka-shi, a guy who worked on Remember11 and Memories Off series, if this means anything to you. In general ChäoS;HEAd turned out to be rather average novel and it lost most of its good parts in its anime adaptation; however, ChäoS;HEAd still has enough impressive ideas and nice concepts to\n\n...\n\nbe memorable. And thanks to it I took my interest in Steins;Gate anime adaptation, when the word about it got out.\n\nSo, Steins;Gate, the second fruit of Nitroplus & 5pb. collaboration’s labour, is again written by Hayashi-shi. (I haven’t read the original novel, so I won’t reference it in my review.) The story revolves around a group of people who remodel their microwave into a device capable of sending text messages to the past. The first part of the series is dedicated to introduction of various characters and showing them fooling around with the microwave — standard stuff. The enjoyment here mostly depends on how much sympathy do you have for the characters, so let’s take a quick look on the roster.\n\nHashida Itaru, a fat geek, otaku and “super haker”. Calm, lazy and perverted, but won’t go as far as stealing woman’s pants to wear them on his head, which in fact makes him one of the most well-written geek characters in modern anime.\n\nShiina Mayuri, a moe girl, cheerful, merry and voiced by Hanazawa Kana-shi. Since I hear her a lot nowadays, her voice doesn’t sound as cute as it used to be a year ago, but still she does a nice work singing “tutturū” on this role.\n\nMakise Kurisu, a science genius and tsundere. She can be a bit cliché because of her character definition, but becomes more complex and deep character as the series progresses, so I find her rather likeable and interesting sort of person.\n\nThere are, of course, more characters in the series and these three are not all of the important ones, but I can’t spend all my review listing them like some Wikipedia, so let’s proceed.\n\n“But hey, wait, Tsunekicchi!” Some of you can interrupt me. “That’s okay to skip some of the characters, but you said nothing about the protagonist!”\n\nYep, right. That’s because I consider him so important that I’m going to give him a whole paragraph.\n\nSo, Hōōin Kyōma, or Okabe Rintarō as some humie humans tend to call him, a lab-coat-wearing self-proclaimed mad scientist and, as I already mentioned, the protagonist of the series. Very original and distinctive, one can call him “a parody of parody mad scientist characters” with all his feigned paranoid behaviour and maniacal laughter. For me most of the fun in the show was delivered by Okabe’s interaction with other characters, his exaggerated reactions and fanatical devotion to the chosen stereotype. Of course, he is not there just for comic relief since he’s the protagonist, so you’ll see another, serious and caring, side of his person. Personally I think that at least one third of its success Steins;Gate owes to this guy. (He shares my fondness for Dr Pepper, an intellectual drink for the chosen ones, so I can probably be a little partial while describing him. Just saying.)\n\nAnother great share of success is obtained by the second part of the show, where the pace of storytelling speeds up and most of plot twists happen and where the characters you probably grew to like face the problems their invention caused. And allow me to tell you, Steins;Gate is really good at drama. It’s been a long time since I last felt that way while watching anime, as this series is capable of triggering a lot of complex emotions, especially if you empathize with the characters.\n\nOverall the stylistics of Steins;Gate leaves a nice feeling with all its culture references ranged from Back to the Future films to Large Hadron Collider, and with all its “make-believe science” and technobabble. Well, there are some things hard to swallow (compress 3.24 terabytes of data into 36 bytes using a black hole… no, seriously, what the hell, Makise?), but as I always thought, the moment you’ll start taking all fiction seriously your life is ruined.\n\nAnimation is rather nice and good looking. And regarding the soundtrack, it’s wonderful. Both the opening theme by Itō Kanako-shi (who appears in pretty much every Nitroplus-affiliated project) and the ending theme by Sakakibara Yui-shi (who I remember as seiyū of Kishimoto Ayase, my favourite character from ChäoS;HEAd) sound magnificent and it was a pleasure to listen to them.\n\nOkay, Steins;Gate is definitely worth watching, if you still hesitating. I will really miss this series (and looking forward to the film, of course). Steins;Gate is an impressive and influential piece of fiction, and one more thing I appreciate in it is that it brings back one of the classical sci-fi themes — the rules and problems of time travel — which is not common in modern anime. Plus Steins;Gate made me remember my favourite novel by Mr Isaac Asimov, as it has similar dénouement and triggers similar thoughts. Their plot is much different, however, but I still don’t want to mention the title of the novel for spoiler reasons just in case.\n\nPhew, guys, I like a way too many aspects of Steins;Gate to rate it anything lower than 10 points, so nothing can be done here. Well-earned 10 points. El… Psy… Congroo.\n\nP.S. Looks like Robotics;Notes, the upcoming third visual novel by Nitroplus & 5pb., deserves to be looked forward to. And it has story that deals with something like fighting games and robots.

It was complete garbage. The first 12 episodes are disgustingly slow, bad, and unappealing. And the characters just suck, they are so boring and one dimensional. They didn't feel real, they just felt like convenient plot devices. I couldn't care less who died, they were just so BORING and useless and the main character was just a waste of time. You're telling me this buffoon who is constantly talking to himself and isn't funny whatsoever built a time machine. Every time he pretended to be a mad scientist i just wanted him to shut the fuck up. \n\nThe only\n\n...\n\nredeeming quality is the suspense, a suspense you only really get to experience after the worst 12 episodes you will ever watch in your life. I'm not gonna lie, I was interested in finding out how the MC was going to solve his problem and I was hoping the anime would get as good as everyone said it would. But every episode was damn near unbearable, I couldnt understand the hype, I was trying so desperately to find out what was actually good about this anime. I hated almost every single cast member in this show, absolutely despised their uni-dimensionality. \"TUTURU\" more like just fucking die please.\n\nAfter completing this anime I felt disgusted, in much the same way you would feel disgusted after masturbating to some questionable porn.\n\nNever again... I am never again watching this horrible anime\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Anumeman (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 15, 2013\n\nKirii-chan\n\nRecommended\n\n This is what should be considered as art, not what is considered as art nowadays. Sadly, nowadays among the majority of people, Anime is just considered as nonsensical and childish trash. It is drawn, so it is immature. This is what the majority thinks, and this is why it is normally difficult to find any Otaku living in near of you. It's a shame actually, that they will not experience this awesomeness, and obviously I am looking at Steins;Gate when I am saying that. Ironically, I've recently been pretty much the same, like, two or three months ago. But I tried Anime and was\n\n...\n\namazed. I hate myself for disliking Anime in the past because I thought it was immature, especially when Anime like Steins;Gate exist, which includes an immensely clever and emotional story. I love this Anime from the bottom of my heart, and really, I will slap the one who thinks that Steins;Gate is immature.\n\nThe plot of this Anime is really creative and clever as well. In fact, I have never seen something like this before. It's about a 17 year-old scientist, named Okabe Rintarou, who is highly intrigued of time travels and believes that they are possible, and meets a 18 year-old woman, named Makise Kurisu, who does not think so. In the beginning, he has three laboratory members. Hashida Itaru, also known as Daru, and Shiina Mayuri. During his research of time travels, he obtains more laboratory members due to the oddest situations. Once, in a scientific building, he saw the corpse of Makise Kurisu. He sent a E-Mail to Daru, and oddly, it says that he sent it one week ago. Confused, he concludes that the E-Mail was sent to the past, and right after his conclusion, he saw Makisa Kurisu alive, although he has seen her corpse.\n\nSteins;Gate has done something none of the Anime I have seen so far has done. The story is absolutely consistent, it is totally flawless. Some parts of the story are really difficult to follow, and although the story is so complicated were mistakes are easily done, Steins;Gate did it perfectly. Even if haters were supposed to find a mistake in the story, they would fail. The story is absolutely flawless, and then it's even brilliant, too. The only thing I failed to understand is how everything that is written in a D-Mail will automatically be realized. In the past, it would have the same effect as a E-Mail, so that fact should be clarified, but maybe I just missed it. Nonetheless, you can dislike the story, but never say it is a flaw.\n\nThe story is interesting all the way, but you will easily get lost, so when you are watching Steins;Gate, make sure you do not turn your brain completely off and concentrate in order to understand the story decently. If you understand it, you will see why it is so clever, and it is actually really interesting, too, especially how the time travel theories would actually make sense, even though it is impossible to do. It sounds like it would actually work, which is quite interesting.\n\nWhile the pacing might feel really slow in the first twelve episodes, after you watched them and look back to what happened, you recognize that they have actually accomplished more than it feels. If the creators would try to make the pacing feel faster, it would probably end up horribly rushed, so actually, even if it feels sometimes the opposite, the pacing is perfect. This Anime gives you the feeling that it will always go on like that, but it would end up having 12 or 13 episodes, would not be dramatic at all, wouldn't be as popular as it is, and SERN would feel completely out of place. The plot-twist in episode 12 was definitely surprising, but it was amazing. It feels like now it would get deeper in the thriller genre and comedy will totally be left out, but it is interesting how Steins;Gate does actually never loose its comedy. It doesn't feel out of place and it's actually really hilarious as well.\n\nThere is one aspect Steins;Gate lacks at immensely - the character development. Actually, only Okabe Rintarou and Makise Kurisu are developing slightly, but their personalities never change. To be honest, character development in Steins;Gate was not too necessary, though. It is always refreshing to see how the characters are always the same, and it is good that the only existing character development in this Anime doesn't change the personalities and the comedy. Every character has an unique personality, which is cool and/or hilarious in various ways. Okabe for instance, gives everyone odd nicknames (including himself) and has odd habits, but is serious when necessary. No secondary character feels actually out of place and plays a fair role, and most of them hide a certain secret as well.\n\nEvery character has an unique appearance and seems to never actually change its clothes. Okabe wears always his laboratory coat, while Mayuri wears always the same hat and dress. Kurisu always wears her pullover so, that it doesn't cover her shoulders, and Daru's clothes are pretty much Standard. Mayuri's eyebrows look strange, but I guess it has a purpose. As far as I know, \"mayu\" is Japanese and means \"eyebrow\" in English, so that is probably their intention. The animation is usually not bad nor good, but there are situations where the animation is wonderful. In Anime the animation tends to be occasionally particularly fluid, and Steins;Gate is no exception. The art is a true eye-candy. It looks truly outstanding. The eyes look a little bit strange, but it is tolerable. The backgrounds are mostly detailed create a decent atmosphere. \n\nThe Seiyuu cast has done an amazing job. Okabe's voice fits just perfectly for a mad scientist, and Kurisu's voice sounds great and fitting as well. Mayuri's voice is also amazing and fits perfectly, too, not to mention Daru's voice. They definitely made proper choices and they do not sound lifeless or emotionless at all, they have an accurate sound and even emotional scenes were well done. The sound effects are greatly done as well. In this Anime in these special situations, the sound effects are of course special, too, but they sound logical.\n\nThere is only one opening, while in the last two episodes have, the opening was modified with the lyrics of the full version, which sound better in my opinion and is a great idea. Nonetheless, the opening is probably one of the most amazing ones I have ever heard. The singer has a great voice, and the same applies to the ending, too, though in the last episodes there were different endings, too. Episode 23's ending is definitely one of the best songs I have ever heard. The lyrics are decent as well. As for the background soundtrack, it's definitely one of the bests out here. While most of the tracks do not sound really particular, which are always the comedy and science background musics, they fit pretty well and do not sound bad, too. The important themes are those which are used in emotional scenes, and nobody can complain about those themes, since every single one sounds utterly amazing.\n\nThis is so far the best Anime I have ever seen. You do not have to be into Sci-Fi to like it, it is actually for everyone. It has a really brilliant and emotional story, decorated with wonderfully executed comedy moments, which were simply genius and made me laugh every single time. The characters are definitely the bests I have seen so far as well, even though the character development was missing, but every character was hilarious and cool. No character is actually annoying and even the secondary characters give a fair input. Everyone has to watch this Anime, simply everyone. What you will see in this Anime is awesomeness on the highest level, and in all seriousness, I could describe this Anime almost as a drug. I can not get enough of it. I want more, more, more and more. I seriously can not wait for the upcoming movie and I will make sure to review it as well.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kirii-chan (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 3, 2015\n\nFear_the_Reefer\n\nRecommended\n\n When you walk the streets of Akihabara, you’re bound to run into many weird things. As the mecca of the otaku world, this district isn’t just a major electronics shopping center. In addition to supplying you with anime merchandise for all ages(and I do mean ALL ages, including those quite a bit older than 18), you’re also likely to find cosplayers, concerts, maid cafes, an entire AKB0048 theater, and enough sexual imagery to make anyone not used to the culture believe they had fallen down the rabbit hole into a perverse misogynistic wonderland.\n\nAnd yet even the people who have been used to this\n\n...\n\natmosphere their entire lives have no idea how to react to one of it’s most strange residents, the self-proclaimed mad scientist HOUEN KYOUMA! By all outward appearances, Kyouma... Or, Okabe Rintaro by birth... Is an 18 year old man-child who refers to himself in the third person and always talks as though he’s unveiling his latest diabolic trap for Superman. They think he’s delusional, but little do they... Or even Okabe himself... realize just accurate his claims are. As crazy as he may sound, Okabe has, through some miracle of science, accidentally created a time machine capable of sending text messages to the past. Will this inexplicable invention be his ticket to the fame and notoriety that he’s always imagined, or will it be the greatest mistake he’s ever made?\n\nSteins;Gate was produced by a relatively new animation studio called White Fox, and out of the dozen shows that they’ve put out, I unfortunately have only seen two others. They did The Devil is a Part Timer, which I highly recommend, but they also did Akame Ga Kill, I show I dropped after seven episodes. Both shows looked good despite having low budgets, and the same can be said of Steins;Gate. It’s not a very expensive show, which is fine, because it doesn’t need to be. The vast majority of it is dialogue heavy, alternating from people standing around talking to people walking around talking... Or, in it’s cheapest moments, people standing around thinking or brooding. It uses a lot of framing and perspective tricks to make these slower moments look less dull, and while I’d normally call a show pretentious for doing this, Steins;Gate never comes close to as bad with it as most Studio Shaft productions can get.\n\nWhen something other than talking is going on... Say, during the more exciting moments of the show, of which there is a generous amount... There isn’t a spike in the budget, like there would be with most shows, but they use a lot of clever editing tricks so the movement on screen appears more fluid than it really is, which I really appreciate... After all, a well-managed small budget will almost always impress me more than an unrestrained big budget. The character designs, while somewhat simplistic, are memorable enough. The characters don’t exactly look realistic, but in the anime medium, they’re about as grounded and non-cartoony as you can get, one weird moe-girl aside. The color scheme is dull, but it plays very well to the mature aesthetic of the series.\n\nAside from the really quick and beautiful animations that happen whenever Okabe time travels, there’s nothing really special about the look of this series, distinctive and unique though it might be, but it works perfectly in context, and any more movement than it has would have just felt unnecessary. \n\nThe music is also barely noticeable, skulking around in the background of scenes as it does it’s job accentuating the tone of the show without ever standing out. If you’re actually listening for it, the instrumental portion of the soundtrack is comprised primarily of soft piano pieces, although it’s not afraid to get loud and bombastic during it’s more intense scenes. In terms of both music and animation, Steins;Gate never gets more awesome than it does with it’s opening theme, Hacking to the Gate, one of my favorite openings of the decade so far. Having said that, this is one of those rare moments where I wish the series had split itself into two different openings, as Hacking to the Gate, with it’s fast pace, explosive tune and clock-related imagery overlaying unhappy characters in a way that makes them feel hopelessly trapped in time feels way too intense for the first half of the series. Nevertheless, it’s pretty damn awesome.\n\nThe English dub is a Funimation effort, which is normally a good sign... Except for when they hire J. Michael Tatum as the script writer. I ragged on him really hard in my Heroic Age review, and I still stand behind everything I said... He’s a pretentious writer who thinks he’s better than the material, and makes a lot of really bad choices because of it. In spite of this, his style is more or less perfect for a show like Steins;Gate, whose dialogue poses, tries to sound smarter than it is, and panders to the audience just as hard as Tatum does. It made incessant references to Sci-Fi and nerd culture in the original Japanese, and Tatum clearly had a lot of fun Americanizing these references, throwing in nods to Star Trek, Doctor Who, and internet memes that fit well in context... Mostly. There are some quotes... For example, a Leeroy Jenkins reference in the final episode... that feel so out of place that you can’t help but notice Tatum’s giant wink to the audience.\n\nHis passion for over-writing also finds it’s home here, as a character like Okabe can only improve as his dialogue becomes more stilted and over-the-top. There are a few moments that do go way too far, one of the worst of which is a confrontation that Kurisu has with her father, who’s lines were so bad that the actor himself doesn’t sound comfortable reading them. Aside from that, it mostly works, and there are only a few moments where different characters sound the same(Mayuri and Dabu both using the phrase “Interwebs,” for instance. Stop trying to sound cool, Tatum).\n\nFortunately, the acting in general is above par. Tatum actually sounds slightly better in the lead role than Mamoru Miyano did, which is a real feat when you consider just how awesome Miyano was with the character. Being able to both write and act as an over-the-top melodramatic nut-job like Okabe was clearly a huge inspiration for him, and he takes it to gleeful extremes. The only actor in the cast who really surpasses him is Trina Nishimura in the role of Kurisu, the show’s only truly scientific-sounding character. She plays her with a reserved dignity that smooths out any tsundere edge that the character may have had, and she pulls off Kurisu’s emotional nuance flawlessly. She’s the rock of Okabe’s team, and Trina makes you believe it.\n\nJad Saxton and Cherami Leigh do wonderful jobs as usual. They’re both basically playing characters that they’ve played several times before, so this is well-known ground for them, and their veteran instincts carry them through. Relative newcomer Jessica Cavanaugh had a disproportionately tough job with the character of Moeka, who spend the majority of the series speaking quietly and delivering very few lines, but then suddenly having to scream hysterically at the top of her lungs in her big episode, so I have to give her props for pulling it off. As for Daru and Mayuri... Well, let’s just say the actors did the best they could to make them less annoying.\n\nThe characters are acted well over-all, which is a good thing, because the sad truth is that they’re not written very well. There are a handful of good or likeable characters, but there are only two in the main cast that I didn’t have any serious problems with... Moeka, the cell phone girl, and Suzuha, the part-timer. They’re both tied very tightly to the plot, and while they initially meander for much of the first half, they don’t disappoint in the long run. Also, neither one is after Okabe’s dick.\n\nThe two main characters, Okabe and Kurisu, are really likeable. Okabe is an interesting and highly dynamic character, and he has a great developmental arc throughout the story, but he’s not believable. He represents two of Japans more recent social issues... He’s a NEET, or “Not in Employment or Educational Training(at least in the anime),” and he’s also a chuunibyo, or an adult who can’t let go of his childhood fantasies. And yet, his weird and socially inept ways are justified by the fact that he’s made one of the most important inventions of all time, and he has three very attractive people so in love with him that they’re willing to do horrible things to themselves just because he asked them to. Hell, he even has a best friend who’s a complete skeezwad otaku just so he can look dignified by comparison. He’s the perfect self-insert fantasy for the very people he’s representing.\n\nAnd Kurisu? Yes, she’s awesome, but she’s supposed to be awesome. She’s awesome by design, and I don’t mean that in a good way. She’s a nerd’s perfectly idealized girlfriend. Even if it weren’t for her cool head, high tolerance level for absurd people, and laid back personality, she’s still that unrealistic fantasy girl who’s willing to look past your awkwardness and terrible first impression just because your differences from other people are charming to her. I firmly disagree with anybody who calls her a tsundere, as she only acts abrasively towards Okabe when he deserves it for antagonizing her, but she’s still basically a magical girlfriend without the magic.\n\nThen you have Faris and Ruka, whom... And I’m sorry to say this... The show would be better off without. Their only two purposes in the story are to extend the plot by a few episodes and be Okabe’s other two love interests, and they’re both very problematic in their own ways. With Faris, we never find out exactly why she has such a high opinion of Okabe... I mean, if she was just playing along with his BS because he’s a customer, that would be fine, but we get no indication of that. And the idea of a teenage girl being indirectly responsible for the development of Akihabara’s moe culture is a whole other can of worms.\n\nAnd Ruka... Well, anime normally isn’t kind with it’s portrayal of LGBT characters, but this one crosses a brand new line. He... Well, she, I guess? She’s a biological male who identifies as a female. She uses the time machine to change her gender to the one that feels right, and while her character does involve some ignorant stereotypes, it doesn’t really become a problem until Okabe asks her to change herself back for plot reasons, to which her response is basically “Sure, I’ll go back to my old miserable life in order to prevent a greater tragedy from happening... If you go on a date with me!” Holding the greater good hostage just to spend some time with our favorite awkward adonis. And of course she’s also in love with him when she’s a boy, because stereotypes.\n\nI’ve already mentioned in Okabe’s description what Daru’s role in the series is, although I do appreciate the attempt to develop him further through his relationship to Suzuha. But Mayuri is the worst. No, let me rephrase that: Mayuri is THE WORST, all capitals. She’s a doe-eyed infantilized moe blob, or basically a toddler with big boobs. Aside from humanizing Okabe, her purpose is to make the viewer feel like she needs to be protected, thus adding more emotional stakes to the second half of the series.\n\nIf you haven’t seen the show, but have heard a lot of word of mouth about it, you’ve probably heard something along these lines; “The first half was really slow, but when the second half kicked in, it became the most awesome thing ever!” Or something of the like. I don’t personally agree with that assessment... The pacing of the first half never bothered me, and the second half had more than enough problems that I’ll get to in a minute... But what I do take issue with is when people refer to it as one of the smartest shows they’ve ever seen. Now, I’m not saying Steins;Gate is a dumb show... It knows what it’s doing, and to that end, it never falters... What I’m saying is that it’s full of shit. \n\nI can’t say much about it’s time travel logic without giving away too many spoilers, but it does cheat towards the end and go in the Back to the Future direction. What I can talk about is the huge turning point that everybody loves so much. Halfway through the series, a tragic event occurs, and Okabe starts using the time machine over and over again to try and prevent said tragedy, but his efforts prove futile. This is fine at first, until it’s revealed that even when the cause of the tragedy is completely removed, the tragedy still happens in all of it’s Final Destination glory. Frankly, if you can get through this story arc without even once saying “Oh My God, They Killed Kenny!”, then this show has you by the short and curlies.\n\nSince Steins;Gate is a Sci-Fi story, there are a lot of things it doesn’t need to explain... It is, after all, Science fiction, not science fact. It doesn’t bother to explain how a Microwave can send texts through time, but it doesn’t need to, because no time machine in the history of fiction has ever been fully explained. They give you a few details and you just take it on faith. It never explains how Okabe got his Reading Steiner ability, or the ability to retain his memories from alternate timelines, but it doesn’t need to, because Okabe’s the main character, and he needs to have some element of chosen-ness in order to be special. As far as these two details go, everything’s fine.\n\nBut if you’re going to insert a giant game-changing plot twist into the middle of a story, it has to follow some sort of in-universe logic. The tragic event I mentioned earlier does not. It never gets explained as anything other than an accepted repercussion of time travel. I guess the best way to describe it would be to imagine that you’re stacking dominoes, and you have a pit of lava in your living room. I don’t know why, just go with it. No matter where you aim the line-up of dominoes, the last one will inevitably land in the lava, regardless of what room it ends in. Now, a normal person would be curious... Is Chell playing a joke on you? But Okabe and Kurisu are not curious. They immediately accept it as a scientific inevitability, and immediately jump to possible solutions, probably to save the writers the effort of coming up with a reason for this conflict that still smells like the place they pulled it out of. Hell, even a stupid explanation like “Okabe’s meddling with life and death pissed off the Grim Reaper” would have been a better explanation than no explanation.\n\nAnd if that’s not bad enough, the idea of other people retaining their memories of past timelines through flashbacks is bullshit. There are several moments where characters that Okabe’s interacting with have visions of their past lives to corroborate with what he’s telling them, and of course, it only ever occurs when it’s convenient for him. He tries to explain it by saying that everybody has Reading Steiner to some degree, but this makes no sense whatsoever. I can think of any number of characters who, if they retained certain memories from past timelines, would have been able to screw Okabe and his friends over six ways from sunday.\n\nNow, I know I’ve been very negative in those last few paragraphs, and that’s because I was saying things I haven’t heard often, and that I felt needed to be said. But the truth is, Steins;Gate does more right than it does wrong. It’s adapted from a light novel/dating game, which is a notoriously hard source to adapt from, and while it’s attempts to build stories out of two of the side characters’ romantic paths does make for some infuriating filler episodes, it still weaves a better story than any other light novel based anime that I’ve seen. I haven’t played the original game, but from what I’ve heard, they left a lot of the more ridiculous content by the wayside.\n\nI also appreciate the slow pace of the first half a lot more than other people I’ve talked to about it. Steins;Gate did a great job slowly developing the story and dipping it’s characters further and further down the rabbit hole, dropping subtle clues about the disaster to come when the story gets serious. The build-up is fantastic, and the relationship between the characters and their interactions with each other kept me from ever getting bored. Yes, I said the characters are calculated and unrealistic in the way they’re written, but the friendship and chemistry between them does feel real, and it comes from a very believable place, so I can’t completely write them off. Not most of them, anyway.\n\nNor can I write off the overall story. I don’t think it’s the work of pure genius everyone else does... Sorry, I don’t... But it’s still a pretty damn good mystery, with enough build-up and payoff to keep you on the edge of your seat from episode to episode even after multiple viewings, noticing small, seemingly insignificant details you might have missed on previous viewings. It’s at it’s best when it’s focused on this mystery, and to that effect, it’s executed really well... And even when it’s not, it’s emotionally resonant enough for it’s flaws to be largely excusable. But as a sci-fi time traveling show, it really does make shit up as it goes along.\n\nSteins;Gate is available from Funimation. It was originally released in blu-ray/DVD combo half-packs, but it has since been released as one product in the Anime classics format, and for a much more affordable rate than before. The original visual novel has been released stateside for several formats including the PS3, with the text actually translated, but I haven’t played it and probably won’t for a while. The 2013 movie, Fuka Ryoiki No Deja Vu, has not yet been released stateside, but it has been licensed by Funimation, and good news: It’s not a cash-grab movie! It’s an actual sequel! A sequel series named Steins;Gate 0 has been announced, and appears to be set in an alternate universe that Okabe left behind.\n\nYou can love an anime series while impartially acknowledging that it has problems, and that’s the camp I find myself in with this series. Steins;Gate doesn’t really live up to all of the hype, nor does it deserve it, but it’s still a pretty awesome series. It’s well produced and cleverly directed, and it’s original enough that I can honestly say I’ve never seen any series like it before. I guess it kind of reminds me of Angel Beats, insofar as the fact that it works far better emotionally than logically, but that’s pretty much it. The comedy and drama are blended well, but it’s just too problematic for me to give it the high mark it’s clearly aiming for. Just like all of Okabe’s friends, I accept this show and all of it’s weirdness and pretense. I give Steins;Gate a 7/10.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Fear_the_Reefer (\n121\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 22, 2013\n\nIAmSovereign\n\nRecommended\n\n I'm just going to go ahead and say its overhyped to hell. Its not that it's a bad show, it was a enjoyable experience. But certainly not without its flaws as its ratings or most reviews would suggest.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Steins;Gate is that, as an engineering student, at no point was the suspension of disbelief at the science in its science fiction, or the logic of its plot (or the soundness of its explanations) effortless. It is a good show, but not as science fiction. I don't want to include any spoilers but I will say this, at times I couldn't help myself audibly\n\n...\n\nchuckling and saying \"bullshit\" after hearing long-winded explanations of its in-universe sci-fi. There are quite a few glaring plot holes in the show, and the series relies on deus ex machinas on more than one occasion to dig itself out of dead-ends its written itself into. THAT SAID, none of that matters if you can overlook it. Do not go into steins;gate for Sci-Fi and that still does not qualify it as a bad show. For story I would rate it good(7), but only because it was at least original and did have some really great moments and twists. \n\nIn every other department however, Steins;Gate excelled. In hindsight, it really is something that this show took such a hilariously varied and mismatching cast of characters and managed to make them so believable and mesh together so effortlessly. The interactions between them were endearing and well written; full of charm, wit and chemistry, taking you through the full spectrum of emotions. You can't help but grow attached.\n\nThe show's relied on its cast so much that for long lengths of the show, nothing really progressing the plot happened at all, yet it still feels unfair to call it filler. In these parts the show doesn't seem to try at all, the events portrayed being completely laid back and banal, yet still infinitely interesting and hilarious. The comedy of Steins;Gate is facile in manner and doesn't even seem forced even when referencing internet memes and otaku culture, which is not an easy thing to do. Houoin Kyouma and company would definitely find a place in any list of favourite characters of mine. For cast, Steins;Gate recieves a solid 9(Great)\n\nThe art of Steins;Gate was gorgeous, the character designs unique and refreshing and the animation was fluid. You could at parts tell there were budget constraints but overall, what they managed to do was more than adequate easily deserves an 8(Very Good). \n\nThe voice acting was superb, and even in the english dub, it was hardly disappointing. In fact, I'm going to even go far enough to say that FUNimation and their VAs put their whole heart and soul into this dub and managed to produce something very quality. I personally have heard both and can't find myself being able to choose one that is objectively better. \n\nThe music was very minimal in Steins;Gate and the OST does not consist of many songs. At the moments, it does though, it stands out and is brilliant. \"Gate of Steiner\" and \"Believe me\" being my favourite tracks. The ED was also very appropriate and in-general a good song. I personally didn't like the OP very much though, but that is my opinion. For sound, I give it a 7(Good).\n\nFor total enjoyment, I give Steins;Gate an 8. It definitely is something worth watching.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by IAmSovereign (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 15, 2019\n\nOptigisa\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Steins Gate is one of the most famous Anime of all time, especially on this website, and during the last twenty years or so that have passed, many works that do not deserve any fame or recognition have unfortunately garnered a lot of fans, and we saw a lot of these works get sanctified and venerated by others, whereas in actuality, these Anime do not deserve five minutes of your time. So, is the original Steins Gate Anime one of those Anime, or is it something that is worth your time and investment? \n\nThe story revolves around a young guy of nineteen years of age\n\n...\n\nwho is called Okabe, and he dreams of inventing a machine which controls time, and for that he sets up a laboratory in a modest apartment, then he commences in his projects with two friends of his. The first of his friends is a girl that has no relation to his experiments, but she is only there on the count of her being a really close friend to him, and she is called Mayuri. The second friend is an Otaku guy who is of the same age as the main character, he is called Daru, and he is the one who does all of the technical work in the laboratory. This small team is then joined by other people, the most important of them being a genius girl who is called Makise Kurisu, so that she can help the main character in accomplishing his goals. This is the main body structure of the story which is unaffected by the time changes. There is also a body structure on top of it that is changing throughout the course of the Anime’s run. Each set of episodes is changed to serve the course of the story, and this means that the overall story structure is complex and not simple, but not to a negative degree. I find that the structure of the story is distinctive and adds an effective touch to support the element of time travel in the story. We will go through a period of research and preparation that will last about five episodes in the first timeline, then through the second period, the second timeline which is crowned by the Dmail technique, where the characters send messages to the past, in an alerting manner so that they could change some events which occurred in the present, and that changes the current present into a different version with different circumstances. These changes turned some of the events in the present into beautiful for some people, but in turn it caused a tragedy to other people. This drives us to our third period, the third timeline which centers around Kurisu’s device – leap machine – and it works on sending the present tape to the past in a limited manner, and here the hero tries to fix what he ruined during the second period. Then we move to the fourth and last period, and we return back to the first timeline by using a time machine from the future, which was constructed by Daru. Here the protagonist seeks, after learning his lesson from his previous failures, to fix things from their roots by not tampering with what happened during the past directly. The story ends after the hero succeeds in saving everyone. This is the body structure of the story in a more detailed manner, and it is divided in a lively, fun and convenient way to follow, because the story depends on the machines and the gadgets that are used, and that is a lively thing to have in a narrative, because the events can be shaped according to the capabilities of each gadget. \n\nAdd in to the fact that the writer added something very imaginative to support the story, and that is the fact that everybody forgets any new time change, so they live in the new present without knowing that it indeed has changed, with the exception of the titular protagonist, and this is what makes the time travel aspect of the story tight. An issue is that the writer did not explain why the main protagonist has this memory ability in the first place, but he made the story more exciting by making Kurisu remember what had happened through her dreams. \n\nThe characters in Steins Gate are standard, none of them have any noticeable flaws within them, nor do they have any qualities about them that would make them three dimensional, but some of them do have qualities which manage to bring them closer to excellence, and this is noticeable especially in the two characters Okabe and Daru. As for the rest of the cast, there really isn’t anything special about them. The general atmosphere between the cast gives off a theme of a harem, which occurs when one person of a certain gender is given love and care by many people from the opposite gender. The undertones of a harem in this story are not suitable at all for it, because who is this scientist who gathers random girls around him? And who are these girls who are interested in someone who is as weird as the titular character? This all weakens the believability in the relationship between the characters, and to add more insult to injury, there really isn’t any comedic paradox to help ease this issue. What weakens the seriousness of the story more is the fact that all of the characters are young people of age, which really borders on illogical in a story that is trying to make time travel seem as realistic as possible. The protagonist and his mates are otakus, and not real scientists, and this is a weakness again in the believability of the characters with accordance to what they do. \n\nThe dialogue between the characters is divided into two parts: Technical dialogue which revolves around everything having to do with time travel, and general social dialogue between the characters which improves their relationship with one another. The technical dialogue is fairly good throughout the show, but the latter dialogue is standard and tends to weaken during it’s emotional parts at times, and tends to be strong at some other parts, especially during the last quarter of the Anime. \n\nAll of the arcs in Steins Gate suffer from an issue relating to realism. There is no interaction between the characters of the story with people on the streets or shops in a way that supports realism or gives the story life. To make matters even worse, all of the characters who have a relation to the time travel aspect of the story surprisingly know each other, to the point where even the shop owner downstairs was revealed to be the FB. Moreover, all of the characters are naïve and kind in an unrealistic manner, to the point where one of the characters sacrifices her father so that her colleague would not die. This is very unrealistic, especially according to that certain character, who is supposed to be a bit selfish and arrogant, but the writer at the end of the day is stubborn to the point where they write all of them as kind and naive, in a stereotypical and unrealistic fashion. \n\nNow let us take a look at the four timelines and periods which take place in terms of quality of the events and it’s developments. We have the period of research and investigations, and it contains the character introductions, and the general goal and atmosphere of the story. It is also the period of experimentations when it comes to innovating and understanding how the first time machine works. This period of time also contains the beginning of the Anime of course, which is one of the worst beginnings for any story, period. The beginning moves through the events in an unstructured manner, and without even finishing the contents of each event. The events themselves do not support the general goal of the story, and do not succeed in identifying the characteristics of the main character in a correct manner. An example of this is him seeing the death of Makise Kurisu - who has no relation to any of the characters at this point of the story - he doesn’t even begin to question the matter, and this means that the beginning of the story is an inverse start, and there has yet to be an inverse start this bad. What makes matter even worse is the fact that the comedy is implemented very early on in the story, and how would the writer expect the director to take a time travel story seriously if he was implementing jokes from the very start? With this, the beginning solidifies it’s status as both bad and rushed, and is one of the worst inverse starts of any time travel story. The events which take place during this part of the story move in a slow pace, and without any hooks or any cliffhangers at the end of the episodes, and this makes it hard for someone to sit through it and for some to drop it upon first viewing. \n\nThe second period in the story is better than the introduction when it comes to storytelling, and the events start to become better when the characters start using the Dmail technique, and this means that the story actually commences at this stage. The time related events are generally good, and it is fun to watch the changes that will be created because of them - even when some of them are unbelievably unrealistic - such as the boy Ruka transforming into a girl if his mother changes her eating habits. The social events are good as well during this stage of the story, and the comedic touch from the hero of the story is nice and fun, as well as that of his colleague Daru, which suits his slightly perverted personality. As for the rest of the cast, they really aren’t that developed, as most of them resemble most other Anime characters, but not to the same annoyingly quirky extent. \n\nWe then arrive to the third period, which contains many positives and many negatives. The events start to get even more interesting after the changes the team of Okabe make, where even one of the characters gets killed off, and finally we enter events that are sharp and substantial to the story, but unfortunately are transformed into repetitive and stretched out events. For example, the writer takes a lot of time in showing the idea that there is no use in travelling in the near future to change the events of the story, and that Mayuri will eventually die despite all of their efforts. This subject matter took up a bunch of episodes, either to stretch out the content and for financial gain reasons, or because the writer does not know how to show this idea without using up too many episodes. This turns the idea into less beautiful due to the stretching that takes place, and it could have been executed in a much better fashion. Okabe’s relationship with Kurisu becomes more crystal clear during this arc of the story, and the romance is fairly well done. \n\nThe Anime contains some action scenes, the first and foremost of them being the event where first death of Mayuri took place. Here the action turns very weak and very becomes hard to take seriously, as Suzuha beats up armed men in a matter of seconds, yet none of them think of pulling the trigger and shooting her and Kiryu waits for her to finish beating them off so that she could aim her gun at her. Again, very unrealistic for an Anime that is trying to achieve realism in a fictional story. \n\nWe finally arrive at the fourth and last arc of the story, where the Anime reaches it’s peak when it comes to the time travel aspect, and the mad scientist Okabe becomes more capable in controlling the time travel aspect of the story. Excitement is positively increased, and the characters manage to identify the main danger when returning to the first timeline. During it Kurisu dies, and we move on to a time machine that is more advanced, and the main character begins to try out ways to stop the catastrophe from taking place. The obstacles which he faces are fairly entertaining and believable, and it is fun to see how he reacts to those dire circumstances, and this means that Steins Gate truly starts to get better from the very weak beginning, until we arrive to the fourth and final arc which is actually good. This arc contains the ending, which is very good, and an amazing conclusion to Okabe and Kurisu’s relationship. There is a colossal difference in quality when comparing the frail beginning of Steins Gate to it’s strong ending. \n\nThe character designs are suitable for this kind of story, the hero being the least striking when it comes to his design. Generally speaking, the character designs of the characters resemble the characters’ actions and personalities, the best thing about them being the clothes that they wear, as all the clothes fairly support their traits. As for the movements, it is fairly good. The camera angles were chosen correctly, except for a couple of fanservice shots which weren’t really necessary to the story, especially something that is trying to differentiate itself from other Anime. \n\nThe English dub is very well made, and the voices are suitable for the characters, and the quality of the actors is good. As for the Japanese dub, it is excellent, especially the voice actors for Okabe and Mayuri, and the voice actor for Okabe managed to bring and add a comedic touch to his character, which wasn’t to be found in the main script. The soundtrack is fairly good, but nothing spectacular, as the tracks stand out the most during a couple of moments in the show, such as the end of episode nine when Okabe finds out about Okihabara street not having any Anime or games anymore. \n\nOverall, Steins Gate was a fine Anime. What detracted from it becoming excellent was the weak first arc, which had a very frail and vacuous start, ignoring the fact that the show had many stretched out and repeated events, which could have been cut out from the Anime. If this Anime were cut down to a twelve episode run, then it would have made for a much better experience overall, and if the producers had changed the weak beginning of the story to a beginning as strong as it’s ending, then this show would have achieved excellence.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Optigisa (\n38\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 27, 2013\n\nwumbmasta\n\nRecommended\n\n Steins;Gate Review:\n\nThis show can be described with one word: Brilliant. My 9 rating is deceiving however. For me, I tend to enjoy almost any show I watch. Some more than others. You will be hard pressed to find me giving a show anything under a 5, but at the same time it's not like I hand out 8 or higher rankings. Anything above an 8 for me is truly a remarkable piece of work and a must watch. once you get to the 9 ranking, the anime has blown me away in all aspects and is a true masterpiece. A ten... well that is territory\n\n...\n\nthat only a true otherworldly anime can receive. For me, this show is more like a 9.5 than a nine (which obviously says a lot). But enough with my rambling, on to the review!\n\nStory 10/10:\n\nNow, Steins;Gate is yes, a time travel story. But, unlike most other shows, this anime doesn't just use the time travel as a plot device, but instead, time travel IS the center of the plot. Because of this, and the well written background behind the time travel concept itself, the plot is truly intriguing. We follow a self proclaimed \"mad scientist\", Rintarou Okabe, and his fellow members of the future gadget lab as they accidentally invent a time machine that can send texts back in time, and thus, alter events in the past. Obviously, by changing the past, they change the future, and must in the end try to fix it. What makes this seemingly cliche story unique is how our main character is the only one who seems to remember the \"world line\" before AND after they have been altered. Because of this, he is the only one who can fix the mistakes that they have made. Watching Okabe struggle through a multitude of timelines, repeating things over and over trying to get them right is fascinating. Now, the first few episodes are just plain ridiculous at first, and will make absolutely no sense until, you watch further into the show. I was inclined to drop the show after the first episode because it made absolutely no sense, however, if you stick through it, it will all piece itself together to become a brilliant storyline. Although many of the plot twists are very predictable, how they are dealt with is not, and will without a doubt keep you on the edge of your seat. To go along with the suspense, there is plenty of comedy, romance, and sadness too mix it up. It isn't the best at any of these other areas, but the show does a very good job with these areas none the less, and they are mixed in well with all the suspense to keep you from having a stroke. The show is somewhere between over the top, and not crazy enough. The setting is in an average city, primarily in a small apartment, and its not like random characters are popping out of nowhere like in some other shows, but at the same time, you are dealing with a very complex time travel plot. I really feel like words can't do this shows story justice, so just watch for yourslef!\n\nArt 8/10:\n\nI found Steins;Gate's visuals to be good. The character art is all borrowed from the visual novel, and looks as modern and up to today's standards as any anime. Movements and other animations were fluid and seemed natural, same goes for the lip movements. My only complaint is that the characters seemed to all only have one outfit each. It's not a big deal since many anime have this problem though so it is easily overlooked.\n\nSound 9/10:\n\nThe overall sound of the show was great. My one complaint was that damn cricket noise that seems to be in every anime I watch. It's in like every show and annoys the crap out of me... Anyways, the music during the show is kept at a low volume most of the time or made more for ambiance to set the tone of the show. All of the trAcks fit the scene perfectly and although subtle, they still evoke suspense/curiosity/sadness, in the scene. The real star of the ost though is the opening, \"Hacking to the Gate.\" This is definitely my favorite opening song to an anime and is catchy as hell. As far as voice acting is concerned, in the dub version I found all of the voice actors to have done a great job. I don't really see any weak links and think that Okabe was voiced brilliantly.\n\nCharacters 9/10:\n\nThe characters in Steins;Gate are an interesting bunch to say the least. We have the crazy, but not as crazy as he thinks main character. The genius girl from America who argues with the main character all the time. The cute, innocent childhood friend. The fat, perverted, anime obsessed hacker. The cool, mysterious girl. The cosplaying waitress girl. The absolutely crazy girl who likes to text. And that's about it. On their own, each character isn't that special. But the interactions they have with each other, particularly those between Okabe and Kurisu Makise, bring out unexpected sides from the characters and really make you enjoy watching them. The intriguing plot line, and time travel element only enhances the strength of the characters as well because you get to see them remaining true to themselves even as (unknown to all but Okabe) the worldliness are changing around them. My one gripe is that the back stories of most of the characters aren't well developed, but really when the plot is about jumping around in time, adding another time period into the picture could complicate things beyond the writers' control.\n\nEnjoyment 10/10:\n\nBetween Okabe and Makise's exchanges, the brain frying complexities of time travel, and the suspense of the story, there was never a moment after the dreadful episode 1 that I didn't thoroughly enjoy myself. By the second half of the show I was on the edge of my seat for each episode. This show made many laugh plenty of times, and although the show didn't manage to make me cry, i was still VERY sympathetic to the characters as they dealt with hardships. However, what made this show so enjoyable was the suspense and the intriguing story that gave birth to it. Steins;Gate made me actually care about what happened in the plot, and made me want to see everything work out for Okabe.\n\nOverall (9.5/10):\n\nIt doesn't matter what kind if show you think you like. You will love this one. This show wasn't perfect. But it was pretty damn close. It had almost everything you could ask for in an anime without overdoing anything. Action, drama, comedy, suspense, oh god suspense! I feel kind of guilty for not giving this anime a 10. I have been changing my mind over and over on whether or not it should be. I decided since that because there was a small bit of doubt, I would give it a 9. Perhaps in another worldline, myanimelist allows the use of decimals in user reviews. Howeverm in this world line they don't, so I will have to leave this anime with a \"mere\" 9. If I could though, I would give it a 9.5. \n\nVerdict:\n\nFantastic. A show that will keep you on the edge of your seat while your brain fries like an omelette. A must watch for everyone.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Brilliant story\n\n+ Concept and use of time travel actually works\n\n+ Greatest opening song ever\n\n+ Suspenseful as f**k\n\nCons:\n\n- Minor flaws in character development and art\n\n- Some minor, barely significant plot holes are left unanswered\n\nIf you liked Steins;Gate, watch...\n\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica:\n\nIt's hard to get too into why they are similar without spoilers, but trust me... both of these shows are brilliant and can be extremely similar at times when it comes to edge of your seat excitement in a dark form.\n\nClannad After Story:\n\nIf you enjoyed the romantic aspect of Steins;Gate, do not hesitate to watch Clannad. Regardless of what you like, I recommend Clannad, but there were definite similarities between these shows in terms of the tragic romance department.\n\n9.5/10 - Brilliant\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by wumbmasta (\n19\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 27, 2013\n\nMurasa22\n\nRecommended\n\n Who knew physics, that story boring as hell taught by our high school fat teacher would be so cool?\n\nNo, my little friends, I do not hate physics. In fact, quite the contrary: I have always been fascinated by the crazy theories that modern physics has brought us, especially in the areas of Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Cosmology. It was due to this personal interest that led me to seek Steins; Gate. Incidentally, let us say in passing, with great delay. Another one joined the list \"Animes that should have watched before.\"\n\nThe major plot of the anime is nothing less than the big taboo popularized by\n\n...\n\nEinstein: Time travel. Yes, for those who are unaware of it or find it funny, time travel is theoretically possible, we just do not have such technology. Yet. Perhaps this is one of the most fascinating things in the anime.\n\nThe story of Steins; Gate takes place in a laboratory Akihabara, having as protagonists physicists Rintaro Okabe, the self-proclaimed Mad Scientist Houin Kyoma and Makise Kurisu, a young prodigy who is in japan passing.\n\nWe have as great antagonist anime none other than the SERN! Yes, you've heard? The SERN, or European Organization for Nuclear Research does exist. It is the largest particle physics laboratory in the world, famous for having developed the LHC in 2007, an instrument that would try to collide particles at the speed of light, much feared by their risk of eventual generation of a Black Hole, which once created would expand indefinitely to suck our planet and everything in it orbits.\n\nWarning them of the forehand: you will find the beginning of the anime a little confusing. But do not worry, it's normal. A tip that I give you here is simple: do not worry about understanding the story in the first episode, but try to remember the details displayed on it, because later they will be resumed.\n\nWith 24 episodes, the anime is divided into two parts: the first, in which the pair of scientists, together with team mates from the laboratory is focused on the research and development methods of time travel, very light and funny, practically a Slice of Life of a crazy guy doing scientific experiments. Incidentally, here's one of the great successes of the anime: Steins; Gate can have a really clever comedy and very good, without having to resort to clichés resources like little songs, beatings, moe and other inductive methods to laughter. In the second part of the anime it changes dramatically: turns into drama, become sad and full of action and suspense at the same time.\n\nIf you've seen the movie The Butterfly Effect, will definitely familiarize yourself with the second part, since the anime also addresses, in a much more evidently that part of physics belonging to Chaos Theory. And it would be impossible not to talk. It's practically a consequentialist logic: changing certain fact already accomplished generates thus a Butterfly Effect.\n\nSteins; Gate is an anime for those seeking thrills: is an anime to laugh, cry and even gasp with certain events that happen throughout the episodes.\n\nDo not miss it.\n\n*Sorry for my bad english, since it is not my native language.*\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Murasa22 (\n7\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

Too many things can be said about this anime.\n\nI didn't play at the VN, so there some things that I don't know.\n\nOkay, let's resume the story first. All the review may contain spoiler, especially one part. \n\nOkabe Rintarou, also known as Hououin Kyouma, the auto-proclaimed mad scientist. That's the main character. His laboratory contains three members: him, Daru also known as Super-hacker, and Mayuri (Mayushii). In this laboratory, they developed what they've called \"Future Gadget\", all a bit strange, with epic names.\n\nAt the beginning, they met Makise Kurisu, a\n\n...\n\nyoung clever scientist.\n\nOne of the machine developed by Okabe is the phone microwave [name subject to change]. They do some experimentation on this machine. In fact, they discover something. This machine is a time machine.\n\nHere begin the story, a fight to change the future by altering the past, more or less.\n\nNow I'll explain one or two things that seem to be weird in my mind. This part contain spoilers.\n\nAs a lot of anime, Steins;Gate put some rules. And he does it very well. For example, a D-Mail is used to alter the past, and it will have the following effect: changed the actual worldline. Okabe have the reading Steiner, so when we switch between two worldline, he remember all the things about the old worldline.\n\nTo cancel the effect of a D-Mail, and so return to the initial worldline, they have to send another D-Mail, to the same person, and tell something opposite at the first D-Mail.\n\nOkay so here's the plot hole. At the episode 22, they have to cancel the last D-Mail, which is in reality the first one: \"Makise Kurisu has been stamped\". They do that by using the IBN 5100, hacking the CERN, find this message, and... Delete it by pressing enter! Here we are. How the action of deleting the D-Mail in the present can have effect on the past? It can't, if we follow the rules of the anime. I can agree that it change the future, but it means that Makise Kurisu should be dead, and the worldline shouldn't change. The fact that we see the animation that indicates a switch of worldline isn't logic, and it's for me an inconsistence.\n\nAll others inconsistencies can be resolved in the way that it's an anime, and there's some things that we just have to admit. For example, I read on the net the following thing: when Okabe send the first D-Mail to Daru, we can’t know if the door of the microwave is open, that is necessary to get the effect of the D-Mail. Honestly… I don’t even care. We don’t see it, so I trust that Daru do some experiences on the microwave, and leave the door open. Who cares? \n\nBut this one can't be resolved in an easy way as this. They put rules and not respect it.\n\nAnyway, that's why I put 8 to this anime, because it's the only thing that I was disappointed.\n\nCharacters: 10/10\n\nFrom Okabe to Mr. Braun, all the characters are interesting in my mind. We have a great casting in this anime, a mad scientist, the girl who don't know anything about the science, but just follow Okabe (Mayuri), Daru which is more interested about 2D girls than 3D, Kurisu who is the little highbrow, and all the other are well defined, Suzuha Amane the \"Part time Warrior\", Moeka, ect...\n\nFor example, when Mayuri see Okarin, she always said \"tu tuluuu\", and I found it so funny!\n\nArt: 10/10\n\nSteins gate was published in 2010, and for this date the graphics are really good. And just the global graphics universe is... Wow I don't know how to said, but it fit really well with the theme of the show: a little bit dark when they are in the lab, even the street where the lab is, it's like the lab is a secret place.\n\nStory: 8/10\n\nHere’s the black point. I think this anime is the anime the most constructed that I see. You can check all the dates when Okabe change worldline, it's coherent. You can't say that the story is bad. You maybe be able to not appreciate it, but don't tell me that it's a bad story.\n\nI don't put 10 because of this inconsistence that I underline higher in this review. And I think Steins Gate excels in the story because it's a really really big anime, with high budget. Every people have high expectations when they start to watch this anime. And there's only one inconsistence, and maybe, I search everywhere an explanation of this inconsistence but I didn't found one, but maybe there is one explanation.\n\nThe more you make something with high budget, and well wait by people, the more the public will be exigent. And Steins gate satisfy a lot of people, so they did well I think.\n\nSound: 10/10\n\nI'm not really an expert about the sound in anime, so I just put 10 because I like the show. But I never heard a bad music when I watch it. The openings and the endings are also very good for me, so I have no reason to critic it.\n\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\nEven if I found a black point in the story, I really appreciate to watch this anime. It's one of the shows I enjoy the most. Everything is well constructed, and when I start to understand what's going on, you just want to know more things about it. There is a funny part in the anime, which is really really good because it give to the show a bit of humour.\n\nIf I have one advice: watch it. You HAVE TO watch it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by NoytroO (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 6, 2015\n\nBrockemsockem\n\nRecommended\n\n What Steins;Gate does can accurately be described as pandering. It panders with such gusto that the anime has been confused with a masterpiece by a fanbase that is spellbound by being spoon-fed memes and eccentricity. People have heaped so much praise for this show that the glaring blemishes of its characters and pacing are often neglected, so it's time to attempt to change that. Keep in mind, this is a good show, it's just not flawless!\n\nThe story's protagonist has about as much trouble picking a name as this show has picking a genre. Okabe \"Hououin Kyouma, Okarin\" Rintarou is a supposed mad scientist who operates\n\n...\n\nin a quaint apartment, which he so endearingly calls a lab. Mayuri Shiina, his personal sidekick, mindless husk, and jailbait also works with him, along with his fat hacker, otaku, and token pervert, Itaru Hashida. They call it a lab, the viewer can call it purgatory, because the next eleven episodes consist of listening to these characters babble about noodles, bananas, anime, and internet memes.\n\nAnyway, sometime after the mind-numbing dialogue, maid cafe replete with cat ears, perverted jokes, and other hijinks, they invent a way to send text messages through time and change the present. Finally, what follows is the science-fiction thriller that was teased by the first episode! Still, though, since this is time travel we're talking about here, you basically know what to expect from the story: something that is relatively pointless as a whole, because time travel means that no development is permanent. True, while the pace certainly recovers and redeems Steins;Gate from its slog of a first half, its characters and setting do not.\n\nOkabe, Mayuri, Itaru, and later Kurisu, a blatant tsundere, are the most transparent characters you can find in anime, not just because they're generic, but because they exist solely to milk the audience. Okabe is the least offensive of them, but for over half the show he doesn't act like a human. He is a walking, talking weird-machine, alive only to bring a contrasting spirit to the otherwise extremely monotonous cast of characters. 50% of all dialogue scenes can be summarized in three steps: Okabe says something whimsical, Kirisu protests him, then Itaru puts him down sarcastically. More distracting than this obvious formula is that Okabe is really only there because anime fans tend to view themselves as eccentric and awkward geniuses, themselves. Hence, every time Okabe gives a villainous laugh or says something extraordinary it's because absolutely nothing else is interesting about the scene, not as a result of an emotion or thought like a real human being.\n\nSpeaking of humans, why didn't one write a personality for Mayuri? Oh, because she's only there to be cute for the audience and to be harassed by Itaru, who's the most unforgivable sin of Steins;Gate and the sole reason the dialogue scenes are so unbearable. The writers must have gone down the checklist of demographics and saw they were missing a character who spouted memes, so they threw in a fat guy who just happens to be tech-savvy. Not only that, but Itaru's a pervert, as well. How convenient to have so many comedic cliches in one character! Unfortunately, fat, try-hard, obsessed virgins are extremely difficult to like, and comedy doesn't work when you've already heard the punch-lines, kind of like how tsunderes don't work when that's their only trait. Kurisu, who's a red-headed mate for Okabe, plays hard to get for the entire show until she decides not to anymore. Anime fans enjoy when an elusive, intriguing mate succumbs to their geeky charms, right? Her eyes are as empty as her character.\n\nDid I say empty eyes? Well, that's the trademarked art style of this here masterpiece. Since the characters are empty, anyway, the artist apparently decided to give everyone in the show empty, soul-less features. Naturally, this extends to the colors of the show, which have all received the Harry-Potter treatment. That is, every last bit of color and energy has been siphoned from the show to make it more stylish. Everything is a pale blue or bright white, which gives Steins;Gate a presence of light and darkness, which admittedly works well when paired with the unique, doll-like appearance of many of the characters, but also makes things pretty drab to look at, too.\n\nSo, are you a nerd who wants to live vicariously through characters who do nothing but try to ingratiate themselves to you? Perhaps you're thinking time travel is cool, but you'd really like it in the form of a slice-of-life anime? Maybe you're tired of characters who have reasons for what they do, instead of just doing things because they seems wacky? Or maybe you want characters to talk nerdy to you because your anime club's been extra stinky and pretty full of hormones lately? Well, Steins;Gate might be for you. After all, it's certainly trying to be!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Brockemsockem (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 20, 2011\n\nzorapup\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (11/24 eps)\n\n Upon writing this review, I believe the series has delivered pretty well and is likely to change in a good way.\n\nI had looked forward to this story simply because of the plot summary. Time travel was always mysterious and unproven so it allows the writers to roll with some imagination while at the same time adding logic and even modern events to the equation. Seeing a female and male lead I always hope for some sexual tension between the protagonists. I haven't played the visual novel and do not appreciate spoilers without warning so hopefully I can write this without giving away too much.\n\nStory -\n\n...\n\n9\n\nSo far the plot has been very captivating with touches of light moments. There is a good balance to keep the viewer entertained. The beginning I seemed a little slow and therefore may lose some viewers because there is more focus on the characters themselves, but the plot picks up shortly after. \n\nArt - 8\n\nThe characters weren't detailed as much as I would have liked but some of the scenery and imagery made up for it. I will say though, I did like the emotions conveyed in the characters' faces. Since the series contains time travel you can guess where the animators had to put the bulk of their efforts.\n\nSound - 8\n\nI love the OP. I find myself listening to the opening credits. It matches the series visually and as you continue to watch the series unfold you'll find that it fits the mood as well. I didn't really notice the background music too much but it didn't distract from the story. ED is okay for now but it didn't strike anything special for me. Just my opinion. Who knows, it might grow on me later. \n\nCharacter voices: I hear they are the same as the Visual Novel (Did not play game) so it's not like people should complain about so-and-so's voice being better. It was nice to hear Asami Imai again. I thought Mamoru's voice was perfect for his character. \n\nCharacter - 9\n\nI would have given this a 10 since there is very good character development and interaction. Introducing them in the beginning the way they did allowed me to invest in each character differently but some characters could have been given more background; others, less. Being 24 eps this season, I'm satisfied so long as the show continues to further unfold the characters. \n\nMamoru Miyano's voice is highly recognizable. His character....grew on me as the series went on and continues to grow. \n\nEnjoyment -10\n\nMaybe some might not like the fact that things aren't spelled out for them but I like this series for that reason. So far I'm loving this series especially because it is both thought-provoking and entertaining. I think it's doing a good job putting us the audience, in the main character's shoes. I love the discussions and each episode has left me wanting more. I hope this anticipation continues until the very end.\n\nOverall - 9\n\nFor a series that isn't finished yet I'm giving a fairly high rating. Based on where it is now, I'm anticipating for the series to pick up even more so from this point on. \n\nTuturu~!\n\nI couldn't help myself.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by zorapup (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 29, 2013\n\nDashiawia\n\nRecommended\n\n Before I begin, I should make it clear that this review is not meant to promote an anime to those who haven't seen it, but rather, it is meant to evaluate a great title. Thus, be warned that there will be significant spoilers in this review, so do not read if you haven't already completed the show. With that out of the way, let's get started.\n\nWho doesn't love the concept of time travel? Many scientists have been fascinated by the idea, yet there hasn't been any real progress on this field in today's world. Not only is our technology still lacking from accomplishing this feat,\n\n...\n\nbut ethical consequences also remind some of us why time travel may not be \"ideal\". Putting this in perspective, think about what would happen if you were suddenly transferred into a future twenty years from now. You may meet your future child or grandchild and you wouldn't even know it. However, by meeting them in this way, you're also changing history itself, and that could have some serious implications on the present world you live in. Steins;Gate explores the interesting concept of time travel by taking the form of a psychological thriller. \n\nStory -- 9/10\n\nBasically, we have a group of college students who have discovered a way to send text messages to the past, and in doing so, they can alter the world. This ties back to what I talked about earlier -- should time travel really be attempted? Well, the group experienced first-hand just how incredibly wrong things went after they tempered with time. For each message they sent back to the past, the world around them has slowly, but gradually, changed. All of this eventually led to a secret organization named SERN, catching on to the group's experiments, and brutally murdering one of the members. From there on, the story took a serious turn, shifting genre from a normal Sci-fi/Slice of Life to a Thriller. The protagonist of the story is ultimately caught in a dilemma, between saving the life of his childhood friend (who was killed by an agent of SERN) and saving his new love interest from dying. For the majority of the second half, the protagonist travels back in time repeatedly in attempt to save his friend from dying. It is also in this second half that we can clearly feel the protagonist's pain and suffering, since he is the only character who retains any memory after travelling from one world line to the next. The plot has successfully constructed a \"believable\" thriller without too many inconsistencies, and it is subjectively very entertaining all the way. \n\nCharacter -- 10/10\n\nIn my opinion, almost all characters in Steins;Gate are either well developed or just plainly likable. In fact, Steins;Gate wouldn`t be half the show it is without these characters. The group of college students I was talking about earlier get together in a shop keeper's basement, which sort of serves as their secret lab. Here's a quick run down of the lab members.\n\nOkabe Rintarou- He is the protagonist of the story and the founder of the lab (which really isn't what you would call a lab... but I digress). Love him or hate him, you will definitely remember the guy. He introduces himself as a mad scientist and calls himself Hououin Kyouma (he actually prefers others to address him as Hououin or Kyouma, rather than his real name). From talking to himself on his own cellphone to giving other characters strange nicknames, you will probably think he's an idiot. Personally, I think he's part of the reason why this show works well; since the overall tone in Steins;Gate is dark, his character manages to provide enough comic relief to balance the mood. In a nutshell, this man is usually a goofball, and only becomes serious when it counts.\n\nMakise Kurisu- She is the main heroine of the story and the \"assistant\" to Okabe. She often serves as the voice of reason to Okabe's whimsical decisions. Her interactions with Okabe are arguably some of the most enjoyable moments in Steins;Gate. On the surface, they would constantly bicker, but it's clear from the start that they have strong chemistry together. And as one would expect, she becomes the main love interest for Okabe. Thanks to Okabe, she has at least 8 unique nicknames -- the most common one being Christina. She can be best described as calm and intelligent. Also, she's one of the few tsundere characters I actually love with a passion.\n\nShina Mayuri- The other central heroine of the story. In a sense, her role in the story is just as significant as Kurisu's, since the actual thriller part of the story doesn't begin until she has been killed. She is the childhood friend of Okabe, and has an unusually cheerful demeanor. She often refers to Okabe as Okarin, and calls herself Mayushii.\n\nHashida Itaru- Usually referred to as Daru, he is the super haker, er, hacker, in the group, who does most of the technical works (e.g., hacking into SERN's system and learning about their secrets). When he's not busy hacking, he is a perverted otaku who likes to make dirty jokes in the presence of girls.\n\nAkiha Rumiho- Normally addressed as Ferris, she works as a maid and has a habit of ending all her sentences with \"nyan\". Essentially moe personified. \n\nAmane Suzuha- From the beginning we can easily see that she knows a great deal about time travel. It is later confirmed she is John Titor, the enigmatic time traveller who told Okabe to save the world. She feels insecure when around people, probably due to the fact that she lives in a dystopian future governed by SERN.\n\nKiryuu Moeka- A girl who is pretty much mute, constantly relying on text messages as her primary method of communication. In reality, she works as a spy for SERN. \n\nUrushibara Ruka- An extremely effeminate boy who deeply respects Okabe. He wishes he was born as a girl instead, because other guys often made fun of his looks. \n\nIn short, all these characters have their own quirks and serve their purpose well in the story. Definitely one of Steins;Gate's strongest points.\n\nArt -- 8/10\n\nAnimated by the relatively new Studio, White Fox (the producer of another great work, Katanagatari), the animation style is pleasing to the eyes for the most part. It isn't comparable to high budget productions of Kyoto Animation, P.A. Works, and Ufotable by any means, but it does serve its purpose for a thriller. The animation is pretty consistent for characters and backgrounds, with backgrounds being more pronounced. Character designs are sufficient enough for the average viewer to stay interested. Last but not least, I should mention that the visuals in Steins;Gate have somber colours, which work well in reminding the viewer that this is a Mystery/Thriller title with an underlying dark tone. \n\nSound -- 8/10\n\nThe Opening song, along with two other insert songs, are done by Kanako Itou, who, in my opinion, is a talented artist. The songs are pretty catchy and memorable. The original soundtracks are not especially awesome, but they do contain some great pieces, such as \"Gate of Steiner\", \"Christina\", and \"Farewell\". However, I can say that most of the soundtracks fit the animated scenes well, and effectively, accentuating the mood of those scenes. Moreover, the voice actors did a great job on voicing their respective characters. Miyano Mamoru, well known for his role as Yagami Raito in Death Note, did another fantastic job in his role as Okabe; his mad scientist laughs are spot on and effectively captures Okabe's [playful] insanity. Hanazawa Kana and Seki Tomokazu voiced Mayuri and Daru, respectively; both are experienced voice actor/actress's who excel at bringing out the best emotions in their characters. I have to say I have never heard of Imai Asami before her role as Kurisu, seeing how she isn't exactly a seasoned voice actress. But after her performance as Kurisu, I really think she ought to have more roles in the future, for she has successfully displayed emotions on a level I think only a veteran could have accomplished. Special mention goes to Tamura Yukari, who did a nice job on Suzuha's part. The voice acting is overall consistent and great. \n\nEnjoyment -- 10/10\n\nAt this point, you should already know I absolutely enjoyed this show. There aren't many anime out there that have impressed me as much as Steins;Gate did. The first half of the series did well to introduce the characters through witty conversations and dialogues. It's light hearted and comedic at the beginning, then it gradually gets darker as the story approaches its climax. The transition from the light hearted, comedic first half to the more serious, dramatic second half feels smooth and natural. That isn't to say this show has no flaws, because every anime has a flaw in it somewhere. In the case of Steins;Gate, it left a few questions unanswered, along with some very minor issues with the first half's pacing. But that doesn't make it any less enjoyable for me. \n\nObjective Score -- 9/10\n\nLooking at it from an entirely objective standpoint, the imperfect story prevents the series from being a total masterpiece. However, the show's strong characterization, as well as its brilliant plot, more than compensates for the few flaws it possesses. \n\nSubjective Score -- 10/10\n\nIf you only look at the overall enjoyability and overlook the minor issues, then it's a freaking perfect anime. If you're a fanboy, then this will probably be a 11/10 for you. \n\nFinal verdict? Steins;Gate is a gem among anime. A must-see for any anime fan, especially for those interested in time travel. It is a title to be remembered for many years to come.\n\nEl Psy Congroo\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Dashiawia (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 23, 2012\n\nKyoanilover11\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n (Spoilers included)\n\nInitiating Operation Ragnarok - putting Stein's Gate into perspective.\n\n2011 AD: Stein's Gate (SG) had a huge fan base\n\n2012 AD: The popularity of SG has not faded. We see the epilogue (that in itself does not contain much substance receiving extraordinary scores) getting very much undue popularity.\n\n2014 AD: The hype dies down. The fanboys (and girls) from the FateZero campaign take over. Some die hard SG fans convert. SG is no longer #3 on MAL.\n\nI had BIG expectations prior to viewing Stein's Gate. This was especially since it was able to top other strong contenders in 2011 such as Puella Magi and AnoHana. I was\n\n...\n\ntold that it was \"well executed with a touching and deep plot that tackled upon darker themes\". However, after completing the SG I couldn't help feeling disappointed. \n\nStein's Gate works with concepts of time travel and uses it as a foundation for its narrative. It's refreshing that they're including real life references such as the LHC and other theories to back themselves up but ultimately the explanations and techno jargon used to verify the plausibility of time travel did not prove convincing.\n\nSG’s synopsis about a group of friends avoiding SERN is misleading. While this does occur, it is not the focus of the series. In fact, SERN remains a mysterious organization after SG concludes. Stein’s Gate is more about attempting to return to one’s initial world line. The series has a slow start but does pick up its pace later on. By slow start, I mean the first 10 episodes were mundane with a few comedic moments that were not that funny. The plot thickens at the end of episode 11. At this point I thought to myself “okay now it gets serious, way to pick up the pace”. It was entertaining for a while… but then came episode 14, and my expectations of SG were shattered. In general, the arcs following this subscribe to a similar format: The problem, problem solving and finally resolution and reflection. It doesn’t seem as if SG is ready to challenge itself and present its rather well thought out story in a different manners. While some argue that the use of arcs was ingenious, I think otherwise. Despite the direct relationship between individual arcs and story events, these arcs feel disjointed from one another and the series did not flow as well as it could have. Another problem was that each arc did not receive sufficient screen time. Often, the resolution/reflection part of things seemed rushed. In all honesty, these parts should have been given extra care especially when they dealt with the more delicate themes. \n\nThroughout SG, there were also ‘unnecessary’ inserts. Special mention goes to the intro scene in episode 12. This serene scene is sometime referred to again in the show. But what does it mean? What is its significance? Is it a figment of Okabe’s imagination or an actual event that he remembers subconsciously like how other lab members recall events of different world lines? These questions like many others in the series remain very unexplained. The dialogue makes no sense in this scene. Original Okarin? Original Mayuri? If time could be traversed in both directions, the past, present and future should be undefined. As a result, how can one say that one, from a certain time period (presumably from the “original” time period which should not exist), is more authentic than any of the others? Moving on, what was the point of showing Okabe’s ‘timeshift-like fever’ when he was young? It didn’t tie any loose ends. It contributed to the poor time management of the series. But hey, it was nice to know anyways! \n\nThe twists in SG were not as great as people made them out to be. Admittedly, some twists were unexpected like the one involving Suzu and Daru or Moeka and FB, but like much of the show they were not given much significance. You shouldn’t give 5 minutes to explain the aftermath of a twist. It undermines any cleverness behind the twist. As a result, they seemed like afterthoughts. Other twists regarding the cause of Kurisu’s death were obvious a long time before the second last episode. This brings us to that fated scene that filled me with many questions; how does failing to rescue Kurisu allow Okabe to see the video from his future self? This is especially since he did not cause any changes to that past, how could the present have changed? Also why doesn’t Suzu help him at all? Why does Kurisu’s Dad flee from a half dead person pointing a knife at him? How does Okabe with 170+ IQ make such a mistake that forces him to improvise at the heat of the moment when he had all the time to prepare? How does Okabe, with that amount of blood loss, stay conscious? And finally, why does reaching Stein’s Gate cause everything to conveniently fall in place? That, my friend, is bullshit. If someone can fill me in as to why the SG’s story deserves anything more than a 7/10, I would appreciate it.\n\nThere are other issues with the story, but for length’s sake I will stop here.\n\nThe art in SG is clean and the animation fluid. Upon first glance, character art seems a bit awkward to look at. But after a while it does grow on you. Character designs were okay. The wardrobe was fine but the faces of some female characters were close to identical. If you swapped the hairstyle and hair colour between Ruka and Feyris, or between Mayuri and Kuruse they could pass off as one another. On the other hand, the backgrounds were very very very well drawn.\n\nDespite the OP and ED songs not being catchy by themselves, they do fit the show very well. Voice actor/actresses also did a fine job in giving life to the characters. Track insert choices and sequencing throughout the show did not overpower or undermine key scenes; instead they improved the atmosphere. In terms of sound, SG excels.\n\nAs for the characters (note I didn’t include some supporting characters because their role in the show was minimal):\n\n•\tOkabe: Great lead. Definitely fascinating and different from many others who fall into specific stereotypes. He undergoes good character development, which was one of the things that kept me from dropping the series altogether.\n\n•\tMayuri: Tuturu? She’s a burden. It’s not her fault. She seems to be an ‘airhead’ but she isn’t really… just a boring girl.\n\n•\tKurisu: Tsundere for the sake of being tsundere\n\n•\tDaru: Perverted and otaku-like dude. He’s a decent guy when he’s serious but that doesn’t occur very much.\n\n•\tFeyris: The try to be cute character nyan.\n\n•\tSuzu: The active character who was unlike some others quite real in her reactions. \n\n•\tMoeka: The quiet character. Everyone should hate her. Everyone will hate her.\n\n•\tRuka: lolwut? No comment here.\n\n•\tMr Brown: Caring father and the landlord for the lab. He has a nice backstory. Wish they elaborated. Might have made him a better character.\n\nI think what we see here is a recipe for a harem. At times, the show does feel like a harem, especially since many characters seem to be attracted to Okabe for one reason or the other. Owing to the little bit of harem in it, the drama in character arcs felt wrong. \n\nOne of the biggest issues I had with the characters was their selflessness. It’s quite hard to believe that a normal person would surrender their dreams so readily (in a matter of days) to a claim that cannot be factually verified (Mayuri’s death). Is their trust in Okabe, who calls himself a mad scientist and is known for making up stuff, so strong? Any sane person would do away with such claims. But hang on, these parts show “true” friendship someone says, and man tears need be shed. No correction, if anything this illustrates that these characters are naïve selfless freaks. Another issue I had was how the characters strangely faded away after their respective arcs and seem to have been forgotten when they could be ‘selflessly’ helping.\n\nOverall, SG really wasn’t bad but it most definitely wasn’t great either. “Deceive yourself, deceive the world”. You can make believe that SG is a masterpiece well deserving of a 10/10. With sufficient effort you might even succeeded in making it the rage of 2011. However, understand that even if you found the series magnificent it should be reviewed free from personal bias and according to its actual worth. That is a combination of its literature value, its ability to induce emotions, visuals, sounds etc. Stein’s Gate does decently when you assess it according to the criteria above, but it certainly receives no nobel prizes in any one department. Consequently, the series always felt like it was missing something. \n\nEl Psy Congroo.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kyoanilover11 (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 4, 2015\n\nChrissyKay\n\nRecommended\n\n Every time that I go to the \"recent reviews\" section of MAL, there's two things that I'm guaranteed to find. The first is at least one review condemning one of the two seasons of SAO, and the other is at least one review explaining how Steins;Gate is a 10/10 masterpiece that reinvents the meaning of good anime. Funnily enough though, SAO and Steins;Gate have something in common: the reasons that both of them get such an enormous amount of attention is that they either fail or succeed on an extremely superficial level, making SAO a prime target for butchering and Steins;Gate into an object of\n\n...\n\nworship. Look at the MAL categories: Story, Art, Sound, Character, Enjoyment. Steins;Gate neatly ticks every one of those boxes and happily takes its place as one of the greatest shows of all time for meeting the criteria for what makes up a \"good show\" on MAL: it has no weak points. SAO takes all the hate because its weak points are obvious: it has poor pacing, poor character focus, obvious plot holes... a washing machine could discern these problems and exploit them. Then along comes Steins;Gate, and it doesn't have these things. It must be good. Now, I'm not here today to disprove this. I noticed a couple of inconsistencies and plot conveniences in Steins;Gate, but nothing that affected my enjoyment of it. The first thing that I look at in a show is not what it doesn't do, it's what it does do. Steins;Gate isn't good because of what it isn't: it's good because of what it is.\n\nSo what IS Steins;Gate? To put it simply, it's a well-thought-out cute whacky time-travel story. It's a lot like Doctor Who, actually, but with a little more grounded conflict and intelligent plot design (so like Doctor Who on a good day). If you go in with no expectations you'll be entertained, you'll ooh and ahh, you'll route for the over-the-top characters, and you'll get a nice dose a romance and a disney-esque ending (except more clever). I would have loved to have written a bouncy and satisfied review about how much fun this show was and how other people should get a group together and watch this, but that's not gonna happen. You see, the most important line of that above description was \"if you go in with no expectations\".\n\nAt this point, no one is going in without expectations.\n\nThis review is for those who haven't already seen the show. I'm writing this not because I don't think you should watch Steins;Gate, but because when you do I want you to not have to go into it with unrealistic expectations. \n\nThis show has had the crap hyped out of it. The MAL community has stuck it in the number 2 spot of all time for scoring, hundreds of thousands of people have favorited it, dozens of 10s reviews are written every day, and people keep on talking about how it \"changed their life\" or is \"the best anime of all time\". We've seen what happens when shows get this kind of popularity: a counter-culture arises intent on proving that this fame is unwarranted, finding the most obvious problems with the show and using this to destroy it. Bleach, Fairy Tail, Naruto, Attack on Titan, Sword Art Online: all have risen to astounding heights and all have been met with vicious opposition pointing out that they're full of fillers, or have shallow and cliche characters, or are melodramatic, or are repetitive. Well, Steins;Gate doesn't have these problems. It isn't superficially \"bad\", it's not entirely unoriginal, and it doesn't take itself very seriously which gives it a huge defense against anyone being nit-picky. There's no flaw you can hone in on. Sure, you can chip away at the edges, but that's not enough to justify writing a scathing review. It also feels like a pretty cool show, which makes people even reluctant to attack it for its tone or for being too sappy. What happens as a result is that we're left with no one espousing anything but praise for Steins;Gate despite the fact that, well...\n\nWell, we'll get back to that. Time to for the review portion.\n\nART & SOUND\n\nNot particularly relevant. The art is pretty standard aside from the color palette, which consists of a lot of greys, whites and blacks. This felt appropriate for a scientific show and was a nice reflection of how the characters felt about their lives. The opening and ending were both pretty solid, but nothing otherworldly. The OST left absolutely no impression on me, which I suppose means that it at least wasn't jarring.\n\nEVERYTHING ELSE\n\nBreaking up the elements of a story is a terrible way to review it. The story is going to succeed based on how well these elements work together, not how \"good\" they are on their own. \n\nSteins;Gate is a time-travel story. While I wouldn't call it \"groundbreaking\", it definitely manages to use the elements of the genre in a way that is fresh and endearing. Steins;Gate uses most of classic elements of time-travel: time paradoxes, various timelines, the relationship between the past, present and future, but it does a really good job of establishing what the rules and limitations of time travel are and how it functions, and then sticking to them. Because it strictly abides by the rules of its own universe, it makes plot revelations related to time-travel very satisfying because you realize that you probably could have figured them out beforehand it you'd put your mind to it. The device used to time-travel in Steins;Gate is a toaster oven (the use of an absurd mundane object makes me think of Doctor Who once again) and it uses just the right about of obvious not-meant-to-be-taken-seriously pseudoscience to make this work. It was also refreshing to find that right off the bat the characters in Steins;Gate weren't trying to invent time travel because there was something they wanted to do or change with it, but instead simply because time travel is really f*cking cool and they wanted to see if they could do it. In addition, instead of just having one mad scientist Steins;Gate understands that science is not usually something that progresses that drastically at the hands of one person: it takes a team of talented and intelligent people to make progress, and it was the endearing dynamics of the Future Gadget Lab and its array of talented and untalented members that oftentimes made the show so enjoyable.\n\nAs the story develops, we start to see Steins;Gate make very clever use of its time-travel elements and begins to build a plot that uses many of the small details from its early episodes to make sense. It proves that it's capable of being dramatic and even occasionally a bit dark, but in the end it always comes back to its ridiculous roots and towards the end it shows that it can use its attention to recursive detail to craft some relatively hysterical scenes as well. The characters, with the exception of the main two, are all pretty standard archetypes who exist mainly to further the plot and add to the humor, but they are well-written and the jokes land more often than not. They don't feel forced, and they don't feel recycled even though the bubbly moe girl and the cute, nice, and generally flawless Nagisa-from-Clannad characters are essentially built on the same foundation as ever (along with others, like the romantically unthreatening best friend). The two main characters are original, well-crafted individuals with real depth and personality. They're also adults, which should not be such a big deal but this is anime so unfortunately it is. Both of them are definitely prime examples for standards of character writing, and they easily carry the show, adding a great deal of charisma and much-needed empathy for when the show decides to be dramatic.\n\nBut these are all things that have already been said. Everyone talks about this show all the time, and they use far more exaggerated hyperbole than I just did to sing of the show's many merits. It gets described as the most compelling, amazing, and important story ever written for the reasons I just described. But here's what I see: \n\n1. Good time travel. Nothing genre-changing, but well-integrated and used smartly = clever\n\n2. Good humor. Doesn't feel the need to draw attention to its jokes, creative with its laughs = funny\n\n3. Good characters. Chemistry is present, well fleshed-out, elicits an emotional connection from the audience = cute\n\nSteins;Gate is clever, funny and cute.\n\nBut guys, it doesn't redefine story-telling, it doesn't do anything exceptionally unique, and it really mean anything. At the end of the day, Steins;Gate doesn't do anything that exceptional. It doesn't provide any reasons that it should stand above anything else. Solid execution does not warrant a spot in the hall of fame.\n\nIt's a fun show: it's smart, funny, and touching. And if that's why you enjoy it, then that's great. It's good at that. But the expectations this show has at this point far exceed being \"fun\". It's supposed to be the story of the century, a life-changing masterpiece that will forever alter the way you see the world. I, for one, went into it being told that this was the case, both by the MAL community and by a few friends who had already watched it. The result? I was disappointed. What otherwise would've been a show I could have enjoyed exceptionally became a constant source of letdown as time and again it failed to really be anything OTHER than clever, funny and cute. The ending struck me as an all-new level of bad, not because the ending was actually bad, but because I had been led to expect Madoka Magica or even Evangelion and instead I got Disney's Frozen. It amazed me that people who had actually seen something like Evangelion were telling me that THIS was anime's masterpiece. Yeah, Eva has tons of things wrong with it. It's really easy to poke holes in the show's structure. But what it DOES manage to capture in the tumultuous internal suffering of its characters is TIMELESS. Regardless of how old Eva gets, people will be able to look back and find truth, meaning, revelation, and significance in the words of Shinji Ikari, Asuka Langely, Misato and others. For Steins;Gate, that just isn't true. It doesn't try to make you look at the world a new way. At one point, it has a very distinct opportunity to end. If it had, my opinion of it would have been slightly different. It would have somewhat told a story of accepting loss, learning that we can't undo our mistakes or the past, and being able to move forward because we are able to see the importance of what we do have over the sorrow of what we have left behind. However, the show happily threw this away in order to finish tying up all its plot threads and make that picture-esque ending happen. Time-travel fixes everything. Now we're back in Clannad: Afterstory.\n\nSteins;Gate is overhyped. It cannot live up to expectations, which is a pity, because it's a pretty damn good show. What's more of a problem than this, though, is just how much the show is talked about. People discuss this show at an unimaginable frequency. The truth of the matter is, there just really isn't that much to talk about. Once the plot has been reconstructed by a couple of fans, all that's really left is to make fan art. There's no moral discussion, there's no philosophical aspect, there's no new way to look at story-telling or some original element that people can examine: it's just an entertaining journey that's difficult to poke holes in. If you haven't seen it yet, go watch it! You have my full recommendation. But please, don't go into it expecting to have your perception of story-telling forever altered. You'll just end up being disappointed.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ChrissyKay (\n29\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 22, 2022\n\nDislexic_Potato\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\nPreliminary\n\n (8/24 eps)\n\n Honestly blows my mind that this is one of the highest rated anime on the website. Steinsgate has possibly the worst cast of characters I have seen in an anime, one dimensional forgettable characters that are insanely unlikeable especially the protagonists who is insufferable. The concept seems kinda interesting but the plot moves at such a snails pace with such boring characters that I'm not willing to spend hours of my time waiting for the payoff (assuming there is any) \n\nWhen it comes to the visuals and music the show is pretty average and the voice acting for the dub is serviceable but nothing \n\n...\n\nmemorable. If you are looking for a good sci-fi anime there are much better offerings that have better characters and less filler.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Dislexic_Potato (\n20\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 21, 2013\n\nbellellis\n\nRecommended\n\n I almost feel bad not liking this anime as much as most people do, since everyone seems so passionate about it, but as an avid fan of science-fiction, I have to say this show's treatment of time-travel is a complete mess. There are so many contradictions, so many wild misunderstandings of real life ideas, and so many moments where I felt like saying, \"But hold on a second, why can't you just ...,\" that I eventually gave up keeping track of the faults, and just pretended like the decisions the characters had to make, and the things they did made sense, and let the emotions\n\n...\n\nof the show carry me. Because this is truly where it shines. The chemistry between the characters is excellent and it's a pure joy to be in their midst for the while it lasts. So I wonder if by criticizing the sci-fi for its lack of coherence, I'm in a way not taking Steins;Gate for what it is. This is after all a show where CERN is an evil organization creating black holes with the LHC in order to make all of time a communist utopia, and the transfer of huge amounts of data through text messages can be explained by hacking into the LHC and compressing the data using a black hole, which is as absurdly hilarious as it is mysterious.\n\nEven taking it mainly for its characters though, there are some issues, particularly in pacing. The first episode is very confusing, and it doesn't help that the crazy concepts abruptly being introduced come side-by-side with the main character being himself, who for the first half of the show as a joke keeps insisting to everyone he is a mad scientist and talks about paranoid theories he doesn't actually believe. One is left not even sure what to take seriously as for someone unfamiliar with the show, time-travelling is no more believable than conspiracy theories are. After this confusing first episode it then takes about five more before the plot is even established, the ones before mainly being used to set up the characters, and only in episode 13 does the show actually get properly serious. This structure makes sense when one considers the anime is based on a visual novel, and in a way it's admirable that they are seemingly truthful to it, but it does not make for good pacing for an anime. It's too unbalanced. Other than all that, the darkish visuals, and the music do what they are supposed to do.\n\nConcluding, I would call Steins;Gate a fairly above average time-travelling thriller, but mainly for its amusing characters.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by bellellis (\n9\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 14, 2011\n\nBird_Eater\n\nRecommended\nPreliminary\n\n (6/24 eps)\n\n Ah~ Okarin!

Set in modern days, but also concerning time-travelling, something that might never be possible (as it would probably create a lot of paradoxes), explained in a very good way.\n\nArt: 9\n\nNot perfect, but certainly very good.

And don't all of those characters lack in any kind of agency?\"\n\nWell... yes... to both questions... but... hear me out...\n\nSteins Gate is pretty much a\n\n...\n\nmix of comedy and sci-fi thriller, in which a delusional \"scientist\" (or in his words: MADD SCIENTISTU) creates by accident a machine capable of sending texts backwards through time. Learning how to use the machine and the subsequent hi-jinx will lead him to meet a vast of array of trope-y girls (the sweet one, the tsundere, the quiet one, etc.)... and yes, all of them are attracted to him for no reason whatsoever.\n\nThe series though, despite following a lot of the harem tropes, seems to at least try to give these girl a wider scope in the thriller-y part of the plot, rather than just using them as waifu fodder. This is at least appreciable, despite the results being far from perfect (near the end the protagonist literally has to make each of the girls fall in love so hard that it puts time back together... lovely).\n\nTo be honest what annoys me most about the Harem-like characterization of the cast is that it actively hinders the emotional core of the story. The four \"main\" characters are in fact quite likable and interact with each other in a very enjoyable way... but then we have to be reminded that one of those characters MUST be a tsundere and everything falls down as the characterization steers towards the trope-y and nonsensical for a couple of minutes. Even worse, any other character they interact with ends up as seriously under-characterized and pretty much reduced to their one liner quirky concept (apart for maybe one of them, and even then it doesn't really turns around until the end).\n\nThis is obviously a huge problem as the whole first half of the series is pretty much dedicated to exploring the relationship between the characters. As the episodes go by though, the thriller elements will slowly come in, as the characters realize that changing the past can have enormous and unexpected consequences on the future. \n\nBy the 13th episode the series will have pretty much lost any comedic element, leaving us with a bunch of quite enjoyable pulpy-time-travel-schlock. This transition is handled quite well, as by then we will have enough connection with the main characters to actually care about their fate and be engaged in what happens to them as the world around tries to break them. Obviously this later half also has annoyances derived from the harem structure and a couple of stupid plot points, but overall it does its job competently enough.\n\nMind that I'm not talking about anything particularly mind-blowing or ground-breaking, but I personally am quite happy that it does not try to be so. The plot is laid up in a pretty linear way, it's easy to follow and it mixes well various approach to time-travel to create a story that manages to solve most of its mysteries in pretty straight forward and non-convoluted ways. To be honest, knowing how anime tends to be, I was expecting exactly the opposite, instead I've been pleasantly surprised by Stains Gate's down to earth approach to time travel.\n\nSo, yes, Steins Gates did at least manage to make me slightly engaged in the fate of its main characters, at the same time though it made me groan in disapproval and roll my eyes way more than it should be allowed by law. Not unwatchable by any means, in fact there is an ok pulpy sci-fi story hidden in there, but one does have to be able to endure quite a bit of shallow characters and visual novel tropes to actually enjoy it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Eingya (\n14\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 23, 2013\n\nWickedMind\n\nRecommended\n\n Kill me if I do say that this anime was just what I had in mind of -- and so I guess I was hoping for a much better end.\n\nWhy an 8? I couldn't make up my mind at what kind of rating I was choosing for such an excellent played out anime. I have watched countless of science-fictional movies and TV documentaries that I think I may be a pro on just what I think is a very complicated plot, turns out to be an easy story line to catch.\n\nI think I've doubted my predictions countless of times with this anime. After hitting off\n\n...\n\nwith the 1st episode of Steins;Gate, I nearly dropped the show just because it was a confusing-messed up episode. I stayed with this anime \"on-hold\" for the next few months. After months of abandonment, my friend and everybody else started to say Steins;Gate was probably the most extravagant anime out there and I couldn't help myself but to think at how such an anime with such failure to start well be that great to watch. I gave a closer look at the anime's summary again -- \"Time travel\". That sure brought up everything to me. That word says it out loud and my expectations were laid down at the table and I thought 'I knew it!' Maybe my attachment to the movie, Inception, helped me guide the anime.\n\nStory: 8\n\nA group of guys sending text messages to the past and researching on time travel -- sounds like a typical sci-fi to me. What's amusing is how the anime plays out the scientific explanations but still contains a spec of realism in fate and destiny. Combining both of fate and science together is a very creative act that made the anime more puzzling. My use for some science predictions and some of its main components helped me most of the time to get to know the anime more. Likely an example of this is the Grandfather Paradox that I would always see in Discovery or in some sites. I'm a bit of a hype fan for complicated materials and my curiosity does build up as the story goes deeper. And knowing these kinds of paradox most especially in its importance in space and time helped me get to know this anime easier and without me knowing it I started to have great expectations and predictions for this anime's ending. An anime that made great dramatic outcomes needs a dramatic finish.\n\nArt: 9\n\nWhat do I say? The messy, blurry, magnifying, shaking animation (most especially in the Opening), made the art and the anime well-connected. There are lots of focused angles in the anime that just feels great for a video editor to edit. No problem with the art. It's plain simple backdrop that looked like the city we live nowadays already says a message. Scientists 'were' making theories and logical explanations on time travelling way beyond the 21st century started. They could have started creating a time machine already. You don't know. it could happen.. Anyway, I think the animation itself screamed 'science-fiction' to me.\n\nSound: 9\n\nThe twitching sounds of the opening, the great band, the great singer's voice -- it was pure heaven. The opening made it clear that this wasn't just your normal anime. The ending song was more calm and I think it was great. After a 24-minute episode of pure suspense and mystery, the anime ends up with a warm music that tops off the episode like a cherry. The ending song was perfect for cliff-hangers -- that's what I think.\n\nCharacter: 9\n\nTo be able to make an anime with this logical plot, a boring character has to be out of the picture. There was never a dull moment in Steins;Gate because the characters will either give you a laugh or let you know a personality you haven't discovered yet. I've known quite a well-rounded set of characters and Okabe Rintarou is one of them. Being an influential man who excels in his league of expertise and at the same time being able to instill a sense of humor, care and responsibility was one of the main reasons this anime was worth watching for.\n\nEnjoyment: 7\n\nMy first impression of Steins;Gate during the 1st episode was very messy. And by the time the ending went by I had a \"much\" bigger expectation for such an excellent anime who has been making great cliff-hangers and scenes in every episode. I'm guessing an ending that would have left me hanging at the end of a sci-fi anime could have been a perfect ending for such a perfect plot. I just thought of how very \"predictable\" the ending for this anime was as it concerns more likely on time travel. A very predictable ending -- I mean we all know some Time travelling movies goes back in time because something horrible went wrong. It's a very typical \"time travelling ending\" and I knew it was going to happen. I mean almost all of the Time Travelling movies/shows have the same ending or plot going on. It just didn't bring anything new to the \"time travelling\" plot and especially not anything new to the science fictional types of show. More likely an ending like \"Inception\" that ends with your own intuition on what you think could have happened or a new type of information that could bring a much intelligent surprise. An ending that is more logical than the plot itself. But over-all, the anime was worth for the keeps.\n\nOver-all: 8\n\nWatching a sci-fi anime in my part is kind of a shock since I'm not that easily impressed. Steins;Gate showed me a perfect example of what seem like a logical plot can exhibit dramatic scenes and many turn of events. El Psy Congroo. Yup, I definitely miss that.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by WickedMind (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 29, 2022\n\nPSRAZORBLADE\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n -Episodes 1-3 = boring -1 point\n\n-Episodes 4-6 = boring -1 point\n\n-Episodes 7-9 = boring -1 point\n\n-Episodes 10-12 = boring -1 point\n\n-color palette is boring which fits the show perfectly = -0.5\n\n-never mentioned the “desert scene” felt brushed off and forgotten = -0.5\n\n-The fact the first half was that boring to get to second half of the season = -1\n\nPersonal enjoyment = -1 point\n\nAll and all, I failed to see the beauty of this anime.

I know you're reading! That's right, freak. It behooves you nothing to ignore me. Take a good look. Quaff deeply from the trough of future shock. Allow that wooly brain to be stricken with envy. You're reading a work from Critic Member 001, anime lover, evil genius, and mad reviewer extraordinaire. 'Tis I... well, I'll think of an alias later. But for now... Steins;Gate. Seriously. Read.\n\nAdapted from a 5pb and Nitro+ visual novel of the same name, Steins;Gate was directed by Hiroshi Hamasaki and Takuya Satou, scripted by Toshizou Nemoto and Jukki Hanada, and produced by White Fox, responsible for other works\n\n...\n\nas Jormungund, Katanagatari, and The Devil is a Part-Timer! Original and anime character designs were drawn up by Ryohei Fuke, otherwise known as huke, and Kyuuta Sakai, respectively. It's another day at the Future Gadgets Lab. Mad Scientist Extraordinaire Okabe Rintarou, otherwise known by his nom de plume Okarin and his in-character nickname Hououin Kyouma, Resident Hack and Cosplayer, Future Gadget #8 (Real Name TBA) and several nuked bananas later, we have Mad Scientist and Hack bickering in their university elevator about text messages and perceived anomalies, events that our main protagonist know occurred, yet, according to Hack, haven't happened. And then Genius Girl Makise Kurisu, a person he could have swore he witnessed dead in a pool of blood, alive or undead. In terms of visuals, White Fox seemed to opt for copious amounts of glare from whatever light source is present juxtaposed by duller tones, darker shades, and shadows to accentuate that uncanny feeling that something's off. This in contrast to other scenes utilizing a slightly richer palette to suck the watcher to be absorbed in the frivolity or sensitivity of the moment. \n\nBarring the hook of Episode 1's ending, the show's 1st half is a slow build, a build that's an obvious detriment to those expecting an immediate climax into the action. When the shit finally hits the fan in the 2nd half and those who previously criticized the 2nd half's predecessor gets their long sought for release, I speculated whether or not that release would have felt more pleasurable had it come sooner. Would it? Yes, this is all one extended sexual innuendo, and no, it wouldn't. Whether one is conscious of the fact or not, without the 1st half, we would not have felt as strongly about what the cast goes through in the 2nd half. We wouldn't have gotten the opportunity to know the characters behind their stereotypes we put them up to and the facades they disguise themselves under, most poignantly so with Okabe and Makise. We wouldn't have a reason apart from the superficial to connect with them, and the time this characterization occurs allows these connections to happen organically, from moment to moment, rather than through one exhaustive exposition dump. And while messing with the fabric of time is the order of the day, this show also hosts one of the best examples of romance done right. No gimmicky external flirtations or forced internal confessions. Just shared, witty, and sincere moments that are natural extensions of their characters that, before you and they know it, culminate into something intimate, making the next few scenes after this intimacy is realized heartwrenching. This is not to say nothing significant to the plot progresses during this time, because all the while these moments occur, an oppressive atmosphere grows and expands, elucidating this, once again, uncanny feeling. And then a sound of thunder, or silence, or the thunder of one's heart, that dreadful moment you, in the back of your mind, were expecting, that's beyond your control, but uncertain of what specific form it takes. Then, like a gun shot, or a train wreck, or a car crash, it's all over, the pocket watch cracks, the hour glass is shattered, and things fall apart. Then it's a matter of re-piecing what's broken, fighting the good fight against fate. But can he? And if he can, what will he have to sacrifice to make it more than a possibility?\n\nIn addition to fate, the show attempts to integrate two different theories of time travel within its narrative: the Multiple Worlds Interpretation and the Butterfly Effect. To better understand the former, imagine this. Any person's past self decides on one act over the other, an act they wouldn't otherwise have committed if they weren't influenced by something sent to them from the future, a text message, for instance. According to the Multiple Worlds Interpretation, that decision results in a shift from one timeline, or world line, to another. Events and memories in this new world line, as opposed to the old one, are modeled after that different decision. The shift occurs only if a different decision was, indeed, made. Were I, for instance, to send a text message to the past such that it would cause the receiver to commit suicide, the world line would shift, or diverge, to a world where the suicide took place. Events and memories in this new world line would correspond both to the shock of the loss and the absence of that person. For more information on the subject, look up Hugh Everett's The Theory of the Universal Wave Function, Bryce DeWitt's The Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics, and the scoop behind John Titor. To better understand the latter, imagine this. Any act from the current future that would tamper with the past would cause a ripple and snowball effect that would alter what events happen and what memories are made in the altered future. The further back in time the tampering, the more drastic and seemingly random the outcome, regardless of how insignificant said tampering, such as the death of a butterfly, appears. For more information on the subject, read up on Ray Bradbury's “A Sound of Thunder.”\n\nFor casual watchers, the supposed utilization of these two theories working together makes for great drama, and indeed, Steins;Gate is able to pull off this drama quite well. There are, however, some bits of it that fall because of some theoretical misuse. For one, for all the misadventures and mishaps involving time that occur in the series, the Butterfly Effect is only effectively demonstrated twice, the soda scene and Ruka's sex. The rest can be conceivably chalked up to Multiple Worlds Interpretation, so that begs the question as to why the story to integrate the theory at all if it's barely used. The reason, in my opinion, was to provide a convenient safety net for drama and logic that wouldn't be dramatic or even logical without it. The Butterfly Effect as a drama device works properly if its fatalistic consequences, the loss of control over one's destiny, legitimately pervade throughout. When it's used only twice, and used lazily, then that tension, when looking from retrospect, falls flat. Then there's this point. For knowledgeable time travel fans or observant folk, these two theories are contradictory. Any tampering effect to the past, such as the aforementioned text messages, should result in a divergence, independent of whether or not a different decision was made. Reading Steiner, the ability for the mind to brave the memory overwriting shifts, lacks a solid foundation behind its existence, one that doesn't so much bother me as it has others. While Ruka's gender identity and transgender issues in general are certainly problems no one should take lightly, they feel out of place and immersion breaking in the swath of other events that are far more pressing. Lastly, while each cast member fulfills their role in the plot reasonably well and have a meaningful amount of depth, depth that was naturally coaxed out rather than artificially hastened, there is a definite depth inequality between some recurring characters over others, and an argument which I don't particularly subscribe to as a detriment, even if I bought it, wherein Okabe is the only person who gets any meaningful character development.\n\nThe OP, Kanako Ito's “Hacking to the Gate,” utilizes a series of staticky animation overlays, character clones, flash images, and hyperdrive blurs to excellent effect. Plenty is going on that I'd never get bored watching it, and indeed, new things seemed to pop out to me with each particular, and old things that popped out suddenly gained new meaning as the show progressed. To that effect, the OP is a masterful display of foreshadow, foreshadow to events and elements that the story would later introduce and explore. The music itself is a blend of Ito's natural vocals and techno synthetics that, like the visuals themselves, establish an energetically erratic atmosphere. Yui Sakakibara's “Toki Tsukasadoru Juuni no Meiyaku,” translated “The Time-Governing Twelve Covenants,” is the ED for all but the last three episodes. Its visuals consists of a broken pocket watch, a shattered hour glass, and an exposed Makise, visuals which, again, lay subtle amounts of foreshadow to events and come and, once those events have passed, bitter reminders of those experiences. The vocalist, accompanied by a melancholy piano, a mesmerizing drum beat, and an intense guitar strum, is a passionate croon laced with mires of biting tragedy. Episode 22 ED by Takeshi Abo, “Fake Verthandi,” Episode 23 ED, by Kanako Ito, “Sky Clad no Kansokusha,” translated “Sky Clad Observer,” Episode 24 ED, also by Kanako Ito, “Another Heaven,” are all songs that have to be discussed in context to be fully appreciated. And because that context involves spoilers, I suggest just getting to those points in the show yourselves to experience them...\n\n...and the rest of the narrative. Outside of some inconsistencies, Steins;Gate is an excellent show, something I'd recommend time travel junkies, sci-fi fans, anime lovers, anyone who wants to enjoy a great story with a great cast and doesn't mind the slow build to get there. Now's the matter of dubbing the name of this endeavor. Operation... shit, what name would go great for this from Norse Mythology? El Psy Congroo? No wait, that's Latin and Greek...\n\nI give Steins;Gate a 9 out of 10.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ZeroReq011 (\n20\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMay 30, 2015\n\nLaytonsHat\n\nRecommended\n\n Time travel is an overwhelmingly, infamously difficult concept to build a work of fiction around, as many stories centered around the idea can't help but eventually succumb to a vicious cycle of increasingly-obvious plot holes. You rarely see a work of this sort that's not only able to logically explain its world, characters and conclusions, but also able to make the viewing of such a winding, complex narrative clear, concise and, most importantly, enjoyable. It's just so easy to either fall into the trap of creating a time paradox or to fill your story with so much scientific exposition that the characters and pacing suffer\n\n...\n\nbecause of it. However, every once in a while a story is created that somehow manages to strike a wonderful balance between storytelling and scientific logic, therefore producing an intelligent, mind-bending thriller with lovable, exceptional characters to attach to along the complex journey. Despite some minor flaws that hold it back from true excellence, Steins;Gate, studio White Fox's 2011 anime adaptation, is once such occasion.\n\nOur story takes place in modern day Akihabara, Japan, focusing on the life of Okabe Rintarou, or, as he would prefer, self-proclaimed mad scientist Hououin Kyouma, an insanely eccentric 18-year-old college student with a flair for the dramatic. He spends his days alongside his childhood friends, the adorable, innocent Shiina Mayuri and the ever-sarcastic Itaru Hashida (Daru, as he's called), as he works to brainstorm new gadgets and gizmos in hopes of defeating what he refers to as \"the Organization\", a group that may or may not exist and that he believes is always conspiring against him in his various scientific exploits. His main interest, however, has always been the concept of time travel and the adventures of the enigmatic time traveler John Titor, a man who claims to have come from the future but only appears on internet chat forums. This leads him and his friends to meet Makise Kurisu, a 17-year-old prodigy scientist from America who, when giving a lecture at his university, persuasively argues against the concepts of time travel, claiming it to be scientifically impossible. The two argue back-and-forth on the topic for days as they become more acquainted with each other, but all debate gets thrown to the wayside when the unthinkable happens: through the use of a microwave and a cell phone, Okabe and his friends inadvertently discover time travel. Together they work to elaborate on their discoveries while simultaneously attempting to help improve their friends' lives by sending text messages back in time, thereby changing the present for what they assume to be the better.\n\nThat's as far as I'm willing to go with a general plot synopsis without giving anything away. If the story seems complex, that's because it is, especially once you add in the other significant supporting characters like the mysterious Moeka Kiryu and, my personal favorite, the energetic Suzuha Amane. However, it's never once unintentionally overwhelming, and that is a testament to one of this show's major strengths: the characters.\n\nYou'd be hard pressed to find another cast that feels as real and lovable as this one that didn't come from a show with Bebop in its title. Okabe in particular is one of the most fascinating protagonists you'll witness within the anime medium, beginning the show as a hilarious, clumsy goof and slowly transitioning into a more serious, hardened youth to match the narrative's increasingly dark tone and events. Yet through all the hardship he struggles through, he never loses his charisma, effectively keeping his eccentric personality intact while allowing him to mature. His growth is subtle, complete and matches the show's progression perfectly without sacrificing the initial identity of the character that allows you to grow so attached to him from the very first episode. As far as anime protagonists go, it's tough to name one as unique and likable as him.\n\nThat's only the tip of the iceberg, though; Steins;Gate wouldn't be the show that it is without the incredible supporting cast that it creates, nearly all of them experiencing a similarly effective growth to Okabe's. While there are varying degrees of success here, almost everyone goes through a quality coming-of-age arc in some sense, most notably Makise Kurisu. Her role as a foil to Okabe's strangeness is needed early on as she's the one who is able to explain the scientific jargon concisely without losing the attention of the viewer. Not only that, but, as she's the most \"normal\" one among the main cast (and I use that term lightly), a lot of the comedic relief relies on her reactions or responses, and she suits this role perfectly while providing enough wit of her own to add to the humor even further. She could have been a boring, dry character used for nothing but exposition, but instead she shines through as one of the main strengths of the show, almost stealing the spotlight from Okabe when it's all said and done.\n\nMakise and Okabe are the headliners that drive the show for the duration, but that's not to say the others don't serve their roles admirably. Daru is a sarcastic, somewhat-perverted hacker, not exactly an original for the \"best friend\" archetype, but he's consistently quick and witty and plays a role in the plot that makes him more than just comedic relief by the end. Suzuha is an immediately likable and compelling presence whose secrets are extremely satisfying to unravel, becoming arguably the most useful supporting character by the show's end, not to mention the coolest. Moeka may seem off-putting at first, but she plays a huge role in the plot's progression and her backstory is eerily gripping. And Mayuri is, quite simply, the heart of the show who is quintessential for the plot's progression and the motivation of our protagonists. Plus, if you don't think she's one the most adorable characters ever put to animation, I honestly don't know what to tell you.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone's a winner. Two of the side characters, Ruka Urushibara and Rumiho Akiha (Faris) initially are decent comic relief, providing a temporary break from the dry wit in favor of some more overt moments (one running joke involving Ruka is particularly absurd, and therefore fits perfectly). But when the story starts getting really serious starting in the second half of the show, their inclusion transforms from passable comedy into unforgivable filler that completely halts the story's progression. Unlike the other side characters who get their own arcs and backstories, Ruka and Rumiho's past and present are pretty much irrelevant to the overall story, and while Ruka is likable enough (if a tad pathetic), Rumiho is downright annoying and completely uninteresting. There are two episodes, 17 and 18, that focus solely on Okabe's relationships with these two characters, and it's just so boring to watch. The show was finally getting extremely intense, keeping me on the edge of my seat, but then it abruptly stops for 45 minutes to shed light on characters that don't matter and who I don't care about. Considering how smoothly the show could have escalated towards its impressive finale, I find these two episodes to be entirely unnecessary and personally believe they really damaged the pacing of the show.\n\nWhile we're on the topic of pacing, that's something that Steins;Gate struggles with throughout its duration, not just in the middle of its second half. The first half of the show works well for growing the characters, explaining the scientific concepts and foreshadowing future events. In fact, after re-watching the series multiple times, I've concluded that this show might just have the best, most subtle foreshadowing that I've ever seen from any story, not just in anime. But as good as the world building and the set up for the second half are, that doesn't change the fact that really nothing much of significant interest occurs within the first 11 episodes outside of the discovery of time travel. Episode 12 hits and changes everything, but that's still asking quite a bit from the viewer, as that's half the show down the drain before the first major plot twist. To clarify, the first half of the show is in no way bad; the characters are goofy fun which sets them up well for more serious progression, the dialogue is consistently hilarious (seriously, this is probably the only anime to ever make me laugh out loud), and the concepts, while very intellectual, remain interesting and easy to keep up with. I just think the show could have gotten to episode 12's bombshell a bit sooner, which, again, calls into question the inclusion of Rumiho and Ruka, as they both take up significant time in the first half of the show as well.\n\nThat being said, the plot's brilliance still more than shines through despite the pacing issues. I mentioned at the beginning that it's rare to find a time travel oriented story with no plot holes to speak of, but I certainly couldn't find any here from start to finish. Furthermore, they don't take liberties with the established logic or throw in any random events to achieve this impressive feat. Like I said before, the foreshadowing in the first half of the show is incredible; it's present enough so that guessing the events is plausible, but subtle enough to ensure that almost nobody will, and that's a very, very difficult thing to do and where many other shows have faltered. The excellent dialogue, as well as the aforementioned characters that speak it, accomplishes another daunting task: explaining the scientific reasoning behind the concepts of time travel without bogging down the plot in exposition. I was never bored or overwhelmed, only more invested in the world and concepts that the characters were exploring. Furthermore, adding another layer of depth to the plot, the theories at play here actually exist in the real world. Seriously, you could go Google anything found in the story and you'd be reading about it for days. Taking those heavy concepts and condensing them down so that the average viewer can simply comprehend them is hard enough, but working it into an excellent narrative seems almost impossible. The fact that Steins;Gate pulled this off so elegantly is a testament to the excellent writing. Oh yeah, and on top of all of that intelligence, the show is absolutely hilarious, which strikes a perfect initial tone between serious and comedic, evolving naturally along with the events and characters.\n\nIn terms of production value, the show really isn't anything special, but it also doesn't really need to be. Despite including strikingly original art for the character designs, everything else is muddled in less exciting, if more realistic grays and browns. This would be much more of a problem if this were an action show or if it needed to display flashy animation, but the story and characters don't lend themselves to that. There are occasional moments where something more happens on screen, such as the flashing of a timer or the electricity emitted from the microwave, which sort of make you wish they had put more effort into the character animations themselves in order to further envelope you in this world. But as it stands, the animation is passable, doing its job and occasionally a bit more.\n\nThe same can't really be said for the soundtrack, although you really can't say much about the soundtrack whatsoever seeing as it rarely pops up. The occasional background tune or lament to play during a darker scene works to create ambiance, but there's nothing here that you're going to be putting on your iPod anytime soon. I wish there had been a bit more here, actually. Steins;Gate already has the ability to make you emotional, but those scenes could have been punctuated even more with a truly mesmerizing soundtrack. But alas, despite disappointing a bit, the soundtrack does its job.\n\nA quick mention about the opening song, however: there are many openings that I treasure and that get me excited to watch a show, but \"Hacking to the Gate\" is easily in the top five of all time. It's almost as if the entire animation and soundtrack budget went towards creating this gorgeous two-minute introduction, and I'm certainly not complaining. The vocals are beautiful, the animation is fluid, and there's very good symbolism within it. And yes, there's even a bit of foreshadowing. Seriously, I usually skip an intro, but I never once did here. In fact, I occasionally rewound to take another listen.\n\nConclusion\n\nSteins;Gate is a rare show, not only because it's an anime involving time travel, but it's a time travel story that's so masterfully written. The characters, especially Okabe and Makise, are just to die for, and the tone escalates naturally and effectively, transforming from happy and goofy to dark and serious. But it never sacrificed the initial integrity of its characters in order to accomplish this task. The foreshadowing was mind-blowingly well executed, and it never devolved into a show about scientific exposition; it always kept its heart, and that's why the second half was so emotionally effective. It's just a shame that some characters felt superfluous and the pacing just wasn't up to par at points, as well as the lackluster production values. Even with those flaws, though, Steins;Gate is a show that everyone should watch, even non-anime fans. It's easily in my top ten anime ever created, and while it can't quite be considered a masterwork, it's definitely something special.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by LaytonsHat (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nSep 24, 2017\n\nMikochondria\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Steins ; Gate is the anime equivalent of most mainstream action movies, watered-down content-less drivel completely devoid of artistic value aimed at mass consumption. It checks every box that people use in order judge anime in order to avoid criticism, which in turn makes its massive fanbase gang up on anyone with a dissenting opinion feeling as if they defend the theory of relativity when someone complains about Einstein based on his hairstyle. That being said, I don't restrain myself by only giving low scores to teenage power fantasies where the screentime is equally divided between pantyshots, infodumping and incohohrent yelling, instead I will judge\n\n...\n\nan anime equally harsh for being devoid of what makes one want to watch anime, namely artistic value or even some good old plain fun.\n\nWith that metric, Steins ; Gate is complete garbage. It's as bad as commonly ranted upon works like \"There's no way my little sister can be this cute\" or studio Deen's seemingly inexistant Fate/Stay Night adaption. It's arguably even worse than the latter, because in the midst of Shirou's cringeworthy attempts at philosophy and out-of-place romance development it at least presents a concept that has the potential of being fun as well as moving with a pace where I still feel like things are happening, even if it's nowhere near a Ron Paul level. And hey, I like the soundtrack and the magic school setting still evokes chuunibyou feelings in me even if I should be way too old for that.\n\nSteins ; Gate on the flipside moves at the pace of a sludge metal album, except the heavy atmosphere ir replaced by the soullessness of prog. This would be fine if it at least were an atmospheric experience akin to something like Texhnolyze or had the character development of .hack//Sign resulting in great payoffs near the end but instead we have a plot that challenges Wonderwall for the prize of the most mundane piece of media ever created, only coated with sci-fi elements as a lazy way of attempting to emulate flavor. It suffers the same flaw as almost all visual media (thank Yuasa for Tatami Galaxy) where you can't go in your own pace, thus having to wait from the time your brain registers what's happening onscreen and something new happens, except in Steins ; Gate the process lasts several episodes rather than just a few seconds.\n\nThis is of course, after the well-defended first half of the show which supposedly exists so the audience can get attached to the characters. The fatal problem with the first half is that Steins ; Gate never manages to make the characters shine more brightly than the cast of Die Hard & co, (at least here the main character isn't Mamoru Miyamo portrayed by Mamoru Miyamo) with the only bright spot being everyone's favorite mad scientist who breathes a much needed bit of life into what otherwise would be as monotone as waiting for the dentist (instead becomes as monotone as waiting for the doctor, but hey, you take what you get). The rest of the characters are the anime are the personifications of white bread and fail to make an impression further than the stereotype they are presented as. It's fine to have stereotypical characters, but in order for me to feel empathy towards them they need to feel like characters and Steins ; Gate never manages this. Sure, Okabe is Okabe but Daru for example is the fat nerd, and the nerd isn't a character until he is further developed or presented in an original way, of which neither is true here.\n\nAfter you've forced yourself through the first half, the plot finally thickens and for a while Steins ; Gate suddenly seems promising again. The progression is very natural and for once I could feel excited about what I was watching. I felt like the show was going somewhere, that I would finally see the light every Steins ; Gate enthusiast had seen, but alas, I would soon be very disappointed as the show soon would readjust itself into its old pacing the way an alcohol junkie somehow finds his way to another bottle after a few white days, and shrinks back into the darkness with even lesser hope of a bright future.\n\nSo Steins ; Gate ends, in the same darkness it belonged to during the first half, after spending its second half dragging out a plot that should've been the length of a feature film. Heck, if it was only that long maybe I would've liked it the same way I like something like Back to the Future, while the knowledge in the back of my head that it's not really that good, but the charm of it makes me look past that as I shut down my brain for an hour and half and just enjoy the ride.\n\nLet me just clarify one last thing, Steins ; Gate is very polished. While it's profoundly uninteresting due to being thinned out like homeopathic medicine, there's not that many glaring issues with it unlike something like Sword Art Online where there are countless of hour-long videos dedicated to point out issues in it (that somehow ends up being more boring than the show itself, damn you Digibro for green lightning this as the gold standard of anime reviewing). This extends to the audiovisuals as well. They're not particularly artistic, but they certainly both look and sound good throughout Steins ; Gate with nothing to take issue to, like any decent feature film.\n\nIf you're new to storytelling regardless of medium, you might find Steins ; Gate fascinating the same way the indigenous people of the Amazon would find vanilla ice cream fascinating, but I fail to see why the rest of this site hold Steins ; Gate in such high regard. It's a monotone and predictable experience with a dull character cast and the pacing of a sloth trying to cross the highway. Maybe if I enjoyed mainstream movies more I could see the appeal, but to be honest, the only value something like 2012 has over this is that it's shorter in duration, and while it doesn't make it any better, it certainly makes it more tolerable.\n\nNow if you excuse me I'm going to go watch some Nascar for a while. I need some excitement in my life after this snorefest. Or darts. Darts works too.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Mikochondria (\n7\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 1, 2015\n\nGenjutsuhh\n\nRecommended\n\n When dealing with time travel in story-writing, one has to look out for many things as such a topic is highly prone to having many plot holes due to being so vast and confusing but then also being so interesting. Steins;Gate takes on that very topic for itself, but does it manage to present itself in a way worthy of such a theme ?\n\nStory:\n\nThe story of Steins;Gate starts off a bit slow at first but doesn't take long to take off with a fairly complex plot filled with many twists and also presents the tale of the famous internet legend of 'John Titor' into the\n\n...\n\nmix as a large part of the story and manages to blend that with its own story in a great way. Nearly every step and action is well thought out and one can not help but notice the amount of effort put into the execution of this show.. But, nothing is ever without its flaws as Steins;Gate does contain a few plot holes and might leave the viewer with some unanswered questions.\n\nArt and Animation:\n\nThe art presented in Steins;Gate is well detailed and very polished but not anything too amazing though. The character designs are nicely done and the art-style fits the atmosphere of the Anime well.\n\nThe animation is always fairly smooth, movements are good and character actions and expressions are animated well to bring out the personalities of the characters at their fullest.\n\nSound:\n\nThe soundtrack of Steins;Gate does a good job at fitting the situations which further amplified the emotions felt by the viewer, the score was't exactly all that great all the time but did manage to get the job done when it needed to.\n\nThe voice acting presented in this Anime is nothing short of amazing, especially when it comes to the main character. All the seiyuus/voice actors did a great job at expressing all the characters to their full potential and drawing out their personalities in the best way possible.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThis is the department where Steins;Gate shines the most. Every single character in the Steins;Gate universe is explored to their fullest. None of the characters ever seem bland, each and every one of them have their own personalities and are unique in their own ways . There is also ample amounts of character development as the show progresses and the characters slowly change as events unfold.\n\nPresentation:\n\nSteins;Gate manages to keep the viewer wanting more after each episode for almost the entirety of the show, although it did feel slightly repetitive during the second half of the show but that was a minor issue. The twists Steins;Gate presented were ever hardly predictable, it leaves you shocked every time and has you engrossed into the story even more. Some viewers though might be left with a few questions unanswered and events unexplained.\n\nThe opening and ending sequences are pretty good, the opening song especially was very fitting to the theme of the Anime along with being a good song on its own.\n\nConclusion and Verdict:\n\nDespite having a few problems, Steins;Gate stands as one of the most well made Anime's out there, one that in my opinion does the best job at presenting the concepts of time travel. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting story filled with twists, engaging events and awesome characters, give it a go and what you'll find is no doubt an amazing show.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Genjutsuhh (\n7\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 8, 2013\n\nBallsOfShinji\n\nRecommended\n\n Steins;Gate is an anime that was recommended to me by a friend telling me that it was a brilliant Sci-fi anime with a thrilling plot. So I decided to give it a try and see what happens. This was one experience that I feel I will never have again.\n\nStory- 8.9\n\nSteins;Gate initially centres around the idea of time travel and the effects of the time travel and the way in which the machine works. Within the inner workings of the machine and we see the “science” behind how it works. All of this is very believable as it all seems rather plausible due to its lack\n\n...\n\nof flamboyance and its grounded roots in reality. However this scenario does not last for the entirety of the anime as the latter half shifts into thriller with time travel twist added in. In this latter half the anime becomes plot driven rather than being driven by the sci-fi elements that we were presented with in the first half of the anime and the pacing picks up to high pitch fervour which keeps you on the edge of your seat.\n\nBut throughout the anime the sci-fi elements are rarely the focal point of the show and it gives great emphasis on the character interactions and how they develop. This is where Steins;Gate becomes brilliant since it puts so much focus on these interactions it greatly increases our immersion into the fictional world. However there are some minor grievances that I have with plot of this anime is a couple of episodes in the second half of the series which focuses on two of the supporting characters detract from the overall immersion I had with this series. Also the pacing at the start of the anime can be seen as quite slow but I feel that it is necessary as it builds up lot character interactions which only add the immersion. Overall the story of Steins;Gate is original and quite brilliant with some minor hiccups along the way.\n\nArt- 9.1\n\nThe animation for Steins;Gate is done the studio White Fox and I have to say that they have done magnificently well. The character movements are very well catered for as they are fluid and crisp and there is no moment where the quality drops. This is also true for the background and it recreates the vibrant atmosphere of Akihabara quite nicely. The animation style is quite unique in this day and age as all the characters have quite realistic facial proportions. However on some occasions they use zany animation styles and it is very effective as it perfectly coincides with the heightened sense of danger or urgency of the scene. On the whole the character designs are new and refreshing but there are a couple of instances where they do seem a bit bland and unoriginal. Also when the slow motions scenes take place the animation does feel a bit choppy. However these are minor flaws among what is an excellent visual display.\n\nSound- 8.65 (OST -8.1 Voice Acting-9.2)\n\nThe Soundtrack for S;G is very minimalistic and relies on ambient noises rather than musical tracks to create the atmosphere. This approach can lead to the lack of any atmosphere being created but in the case of Steins;Gate it is rather effective and suits the overall feel of the anime. However that is not to say that musical tracks are not utilised and when they are utilised they are very effective in setting the mood. Unfortunately none of the tracks are so good that they are memorable apart from one very special exception: The OP. The OP for this anime is truly brilliant and makes me want to watch the whole anime again just so that I can listen to it in all its glory. So overall it’s a very good OST with, at least for me, one very special track.\n\nFortunately I have had the pleasure of watching this anime both subbed and dubbed and while I can’t really comment on the voice acting of the Japanese, I can say that it does sound as if it has been acted with a great amount of passion and feels as if the whole cast had a blast whilst doing it.\n\nThe Dub is an entirely different matter. After watching the sub I can say that I was rather cautious when approaching the dub but all those feelings of scepticism that I had were left behind in the depths of the oceans as soon as I watched the first episode. The voice acting for this anime was brilliant from start to finish with each voice actor perfectly portraying each character that they voiced. Each emotion, ranging from exasperation to sorrow, was felt when they spoke and it was thoroughly enjoyable to listen to. The only slight negative I could see was the script on one occasion did feel a bit iffy but apart from that it is truly excellent performance from everyone involved. \n\nCharacters- 9.2\n\nThe characters in Steins;Gate are what I feel are the highlight of the whole show and without them this how would have landed flat on its face. To me, even though each character fits into some type of stereotype they never feel confined to that and expand and develop beyond those boundaries. Our MC, Okabe Rintarou, is quite a unique character and is possibly one of the most enjoyable characters that I have ever watched in anime. His quirks and ramblings are wonderfully entertaining but it is his interactions with our lead female, Makise Kirisu, which creates for some of the best moments in this anime. It is mainly my connection with these two characters that immersed me within this world and kept glued to my laptop for hours on end yearning for the best possible outcome. My only gripe is that a couple of the characters feel like an added accessory to the already very good cast but apart from that it is a very good showing in general.\n\nEnjoyment- 9.5\n\nI loved Steins;Gate from Start to finish. The earlier episodes may have been slow but they were still very enjoyable to watch especially the comedic moments and when the anime shifted to a more serious tone it kept at the edge of my seat for as long as I can remember. The time travel was still far enough out there to be sci-fi but close enough to home so that I could grasp the general idea that they were laying down in front of me. The characters literally sold me the show as it was my connection to most of them which was very enjoyable to have and therefore made the anime glorious to watch.\n\nOverall- 9.07\n\nSteins;Gate is a different outlook on the time travel “genre” and gives an new breath of fresh air into what, at times, is a rather stale premise. The it builds upon this premise to give us a unique experience which relies on its characters rather than the plot to immerse you in its world.\n\nThanks for reading this I hope that this review has been helpful. And, as always, any feedback is greatly appreciated =D\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by BallsOfShinji (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 26, 2024\n\nMidnightParadox\n\nNot Recommended\nFunny\n\n What does it take to make a great show? To be in the top ten best reviewed shows on an incredibly popular webpage dedicated to the art form? I think we can come up with a few necessities, though art always surprises us, as it should.\n\nFirst, we can try to imagine the viewer might hope to find compelling characters. Maybe a cast of teenagers coming to age, battling the anxieties of being outcasts, unable to find their place in an increasingly interconnected but also alienating society. Perhaps some are fighting against loss, loneliness, family issues, or simply trying to become the unattainable idealized versions of\n\n...\n\nthemselves. Those topics may be too broad, and without the necessary care, they could very well fall into plastic stereotypes without the depth that the situations demand. Perhaps some, or none, of these issues are ever moved forward; evolved into something meaningful that leaves a lasting impression or further our understanding of each other. A masterpiece must not fall into this trap of empty characters, letting them exist merely as quirks or one dimensional cliches.\n\nOr maybe the characters don't matter? Characters are often merely a conduit for the story, after all. A well told story can captivate the viewer and make them rethink how they view life or themselves. A story about time sounds incredibly compelling, even more so when you add a dash of scifi, warping the assumptions that we previously had about such an ethereal concept. The story must then be well thought out, avoid excessive and unnecessary repetition, and not meander into boring and unrelated situations. The time traveling aspect should be believable and satisfying, with an unique twist on the genre utilized to its full potential. One would not expect, for example, contradicting rules, divine interventions, unexplained breakthroughs, insane logic or dull, unearned conclusions. A masterpiece must not let the story be window dressing to pandering, get stuck in a time loop of self gratifying angst or pull out solutions out of its metaphorical ass.\n\nWell, without good characters or a good story, there doesn't seem to be much left. But maybe we can salvage it! We're talking about an audio-visual medium, so surely those aspects must be so enchanting and unique that they left a lasting impression on every person that reviewed it, so far above every other show that its' haunting beauty or unexpected uniqueness impressed even the most stubborn of critics. For this, one can imagine it would *not* have the same shots of an uninteresting apartment, empty city or suburb, framing the same static characters, doing the same expressions and poses, over and over and over, with very little reprise, which itself is just more repetition, for 24 episodes. It's not good enough for a masterpieces' artwork to be cohesive and pleasant, it must shock and and charm in equal measure, showing something incredible that you could not find anywhere else. And for sound, it's not good enough for it to blend nicely into the background, it must punctuate every frame of the art as if they could never be thought of separately. Every noise must be carefully considered and placed with the precision of an assassin, delivering maximum effect. An audiovisual masterpiece must excel and innovate constantly, and it must not stagnate.\n\nOkay, the characters are charming yet simple stereotypes that never evolve, the story is bland, badly paced and full of plot holes, and the art and music is good, but nothing to write home about. We're running out of a lot of things here, but it can be a masterpiece yet. The themes, the overall message, it must be so well communicated and original, so outlandish yet compelling, it makes even the most cardboard characters and awful story beats shine. It is difficult to imagine this without the support of the characters, story, audio and visuals, but if it is indeed a masterpiece, it shall manage regardless. The message should be easy to understand but complex in its implications and the way it would be reflected in the real world. It should be obvious enough to be noticed, but subtle enough that is not merely a statement shouted at the rooftops by the story or characters. One would expect this message may be told in other pieces of art, but for a masterpiece, it needs to be reshaped into it's own thing. One might arrive at the same conclusion after watching two masterpieces, but the method must be their own, and the conclusions must shed different lights on the topic. How can we consider it a masterpiece when it merely retells the same thing countless works have done before with just a new coat of paint?\n\nIf you read all that diatribe, you can probably guess I did not like Steins;Gate. Obviously, I don't equate popularity points to mass agreement that this is one of the greatest pieces of art ever created. I doubt everyone that rated it a 10 considers it a masterpiece, they merely enjoyed it greatly, and there's nothing wrong with that... But seriously? **Everyone** liked it? I can't see it. We're talking about a fairly bland shonen that does so many things wrong it should be way more polarizing, especially as people start to age out of the the target demographic and turn a more cautious eye towards this type of 'nostalgic' anime.\n\nYes, I was in the demographic once, and I confess to liking it as a teenager. Lucky for me, I did not finish it back then. Maybe it was the choice of the Steins Gate, allowing my nostalgic image of the series remain untainted. But what I liked back then, I still like now. The early episodes are entertaining and endearing, though not without their problems, mind you. The overall message of not being a burden for relying on others, finding solace and happiness in a community, I greatly enjoy and its a huge positive I take out of this series. The time traveling shenanigans that fueled the slice of life aspect were fun, and yes, it was unique, at the very least in 2011. As a bitter and lonely neet, I can relate and understand why people cheer for the characters and are happy with its hopeful ending. But everything else is just bad. It's bad as a scifi story, it's bad as a time travel story, it's bad as a coming of age story, it's bad as an exploration of everything I already outlined earlier. So many moments of screaming at the writers, 'Why is your protagonist doing this? Why is this happening? Why can't we move on from this, it's been 5 episodes already! Why are they acting like this?'.

Released in 2011 but still better than most sci-fi shows for 9 straight years. It is not a stretch to say this anime is the best of the best of all time. And I put it on the top of my list, the number one spot. \n\n( Spoiler Free Review ) \n\nStory: 10/10\n\nSteins;Gate has progressive pacing and episodic in nature, I was confused the first time when I have watched Steins;Gate, as much as it was confusing I enjoyed how the show progresses throughout per episode. The story was very unique for me when I first watched it, and that\n\n...\n\nespecially made me like it. It was not predictable at all since the show can go in a lot of ways. The pacing was very good, There is no room for fillers and each episode holds a purpose. The individual elements of the story are absolutely perfect. Comedy, romance, mystery, a little fan service, suspense, and thriller. All aspects are superb, the deus ex machina in the anime is shown, and is very well used. And literary techniques and or tropes are present. The ending is very satisfying, heartwarming, kind, beautiful and anticipating. As much as I don't want it to end. There is no forced abrupt ending. It was well paced and well done. \n\nArt: 10/10\n\nThe art style fits perfectly well with the story, it has a distinctly unique style to it that fits well with the atmosphere of the anime. It's the perfect art style for a perfect anime. The director did a perfect job in setting up the mood with the art style. Throughout the anime, the animation was well done and consistent. The backgrounds were unique as well, the character designs perfectly fit with the character's personalities, and I love it with all of my heart. Each character design is unique to their own styles, I don't find any problem with wearing the same clothing as I find it quite irrelevant to an anime like Steins;Gate. \n\nSound: 10/10\n\nI absolutely love the OST' of Steins;Gate. The voice actors are one of the main reasons for the greatness of this show. And they delivered in a perfect manner. I'm sure that Okabe Rintarou's voice actor had to make a few adjustments with his voice and for Makise Kurisu's as well. Both voice actors played a big part in the anime and I can only thank them for a great job well done, I am very grateful. The background music was a blast as well, It's very emotional I must say, It also helped a big part in setting up the atmosphere and mood throughout the story. I love it. The music in Steins;Gate was always a big part in setting up the entire show's tone. I'd listen to the OST of Steins;Gate from time to time since it's that good, very memorable. The opening and ending songs are both perfect and notable. \n\nCharacter: 10/10\n\nThe best part of Steins;Gate is the characters. Each is unique in their own way and well rounded. They have flaws and they need each other. And that's what makes them perfect. The characters reacted rationally and emotionally depending upon the situation that they are currently facing. I was able to relate to the characters and their hardships. Each character in some way or another had their own development throughout the show. But more so to our main characters. There are foils for our main character and one that is always right next to him. Mostly Okabe Rintarou is the most fleshed out of the bunch since the main story is focused on him but not entirely, the antagonist of the show is well developed and has backgrounds and depths like the other characters. And to each has their own motivations for doing things. The supporting cast as well is filled with highly well written, likable characters and development. The narration in the show is present in some parts with the main characters like Okabe Rintarou, it simply made the series more aesthetic. A specific character I really disliked was Kiryu Moeka and it was probably the author's intention for me to hate her, and it worked. The characters in Steins;Gate are the most memorable character's I have had the pleasure to be able to watch, and I'll surely remember them forever, etched into my mind. \n\nEnjoyment: 10/10\n\nI think that the majority of people will be able to enjoy this series. If they gave the time and patience towards this series they will be rewarded with good fortune in return. This may be hard for non-anime fans to get into unless they are a huge sci-fi fan or have the patience to wait it out or enjoy the pace of the show. I have already re-watched this anime 3 times. And I'm planning to watch it again in the near future. It's an unforgettable story and the pinnacle of greatness in anime. Even if I know what's going on and what's going to happen, I still get goosebumps every time I hear that opening. And whenever I re-watch it I was able to pick up some things I haven't seen during the first time I have watched it. This show is precious enough that I'd pay money to buy the source material and support the show for a new season. Steins;Gate is a memoir and will always hold a special place in my heart. It's my very first sci-fi anime after all.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Gamer651 (\n9\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 4, 2011\n\nOtakuTrey\n\nRecommended\n\n *Virgin reviewer so be gentle*\n\nPeople will always ask other people what to watch, recommend me something, im so bored what should i watch. People will also say is there ever going to be another masterpiece like Brotherhood or when is something going to become as popular as Death note. What will have the sheer guts to move me to the next episode, to make me want to watch and not go to sleep. WHAT anime is going to be the next big thing and blow my mind for days, weeks, months and even years. well its two simple words and for people to know that\n\n...\n\nthese two simple words mean nothing but everthing, Steins;Gate.\n\nThis Will be a classic anime in the years to come, people will still talk about great anime's like Death Note, Brotherhood, Code Geass and Suzumiya Haruhi, however they will be talking about Steins;Gate as well.\n\nStory: 10\n\nIF you watch 3 episodes of this you will not need a time machine to see how good this can be, will be, and is. The story revolves around Okabe Rintarou or the Mad Scientist. One day after seeing a certain predicament, he finds himself in a loop. The cause, a make shift time machine that will send his texts back in time. He then finds out the first message has altered the future in a big way. After that he then helps his fellow friends by making there dreams come true. The only problem is he will now have to skip between time lines to make everything right. He then finds out he is blessed with a certain power that helps him between jumps and after jumps through time. This stories base is certainly not that original, a time machine has been done in tv, anime's, movies and so on. The difference lady/gentle otakus, the execution of the story mixed with comedy and all together random moments. It has a serious plot line with comical sub plots that eventually tie the story in a nice little ball for all people to see.\n\nArt: 9\n\nThis might just be me being biased but the art was great. It fit with the character designs and semi futuristic vibe towards the end and everything in between. Im not trying to say its spectacular or you need to watch this anime just for the Art, It simply fits with the overall masterpiece that is Steins;Gate. The Art goes from a little bubbly at times that fits with the nonchalant help my lab members to dark and twisted, with half trippy vibes you get from the time machine factor.\n\nSound: 9\n\nIm at a loss on what to say here, the sound just works. But out of all honesty you will be to focused on what is going on to even realize the shrills and bravado that is going on. I gave this a 9 based on the fact it works with the moods, character development and overall enjoyment of the show. Also because there was never a time when the music pissed me off and distracted me from watching which is hard to do in most anime's, the sound is either to loud, noisy, or just doesn't fit the bill with some bubble gum pop rock garbage. when you watch you will understand what im trying to convey.\n\nCharacters: 10\n\nIt just has to be, it just does. i wont even say 1 episode it will only take FIVE MINUTES for you to realize this is a crazy cast of different types of characters all meshed into a group almost like how Durarara!! was. Lets start the Bar with Okabe, the main character. He is over the top shatter the mold \"mad scientist\", Feelings of ups and downs insanely crazy and moronic to insanely brilliant and sharp. solving different parts to the puzzle, piecing the facts together, live and death struggle and impossible choices that are choose impossibly well. CHRISTINA!!!! or Kurisu Makise. The zombie, and perverted genius girl celebrity. 17 years old and a genius. (she also looks good in a lab coat MUAHAHAHA) she is with out a doubt a huge piece of the puzzle she is the Glue to this anime. She is first seen in the first episode in a sort of \"bad\" situation. she makes this story possible. Next Do Do Do DO Mayuri. I said Kurisu was the glue... i might have to take that back, when the story starts out you seen her for who she is and when its finished its the same good hearted girl that you will come to love. Every time she was on the screen i could not look away, she fascinated me from start to finish with her bright personality and sometimes to nice of a person, she is one of the better better female characters in my mind and the sad thing is she is not the best girl in this anime as you will see. Lets review the previous characters and characters i haven't mentions in bulk shall we. mad scientist that is crazy, lazy, good for nothing, sane, brilliant good for the world type of guy. 17 year old genius tsunedere with alot to prove nothing to gain, then nothing to prove everything to gain, gain and loss type. bubbly cute, happily funny, adorable and nice Mayuri. a Fat NEET Otaku suuupppa hacka with a maid complex. A most of the time cross dressing man, some times not so gross dressing women/man who is a shrine maiden with a hard crush and sometimes Broken heart. Moe cosplay maid fancy rich girl who has nothing while at the same time has everything but would rather have one thing than everything. future girl who sometimes knows everything, looking for her father when he is under her nose. A average store owner who is not so average nice but hard on rent then mean and murderous. Ok take all that into consideration and try to put those characters in any other anime and make it work.... you tired and failed why, because it can not be done.\n\nEnjoyment: 10\n\ncome on if you actually read this review thus far you would have a very good idea to why this was so enjoyable, and if you made it this far here *Gold Star*\n\nOverall: 10\n\nChild Please! twist's and turns, abnormally fantastic character development, surprisingly simply and complex at the same time. At the end you will be thinking about what was said for weeks to come, it has been months since i have watched this and i remember it so very clearly. That is the sign of a great anime.\n\nFinal thought...\n\nWATCH! or else there wont be any time machines in the future! and we all want time machines, this deserves its score, its not some hyper inflated anime that has been made up from hype. watch, listen, read, learn..... you must do it John Titor said so.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by OtakuTrey (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nPrevious\n - \nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

I Consider myself to be a not so cruel scorer always giving anime a chance and always looking for positives but this is not the case for No Game No Life with me. Considered to be the next best thing since canned bread everybody seems to love this and I'm the only one who cant see what is so good about it. I will try to give my vision on the show in the next couple of sections so please bare with me.\n\nStory\n\nThe story without giving away too much its about 2 overly intelligent pair\n\n...\n\nof step brothers Sora and Shiro who are portrayed as neets. They are bored with normal life and just love to play videogames. One day they get the opportunity to join a game world where 16 races rule. In the game world extreme and weird games exist with rules varying per agreement of the players so everything is at stake. All seems peaches and cream for an interesting anime with some good story movement except that the story progression is really slow.\n\nArt\n\nTo sum it all up its really nice neon colors. Very fluid and detailed animation especially the background. I have to say that despite not enjoying the anime this is its strongest asset and its really pleasing to the eye. Madhouse really did a good job with the art and I think its top 2 of the season along with Bokura Wa mina Kawaisou. \n\nSound \n\nI don't think it was over the top or memorable that you want to buy the OST's or anything. Nothing really negative else to say by my part except that it was solid.\n\nCharacters (Only will be covering 3)\n\na) Sora - Main character, 18 year old neet who lives with his loli stepsister Shiro. Overly intelligent and with many sexual needs (according to the show). Sora quickly became an apparent icon this season for best character this season and all I can say is why? One of Sora's biggest strengths is also his downfall as a character and this is his super intelligence. Nothing is ever a challenge in this supposed challenging game world to him and he always seems to have a plan for everything. He tries to be too cool for my liking. I never found any of his jokes or references to be funny or entertaining only just kinda corny.\n\nb) Shiro - The other main character, 11 year old step sister of Sora. More intelligent than Sora apparently and has a brother complex. With Shiro its another case of overuse of Lolis for roles that can be fulfilled with normal characters along with Black Bullet. I don't get the semi naked scenes of Shiro which in this case is a minor throughout the show and it feels a bit disturbing. Shiro's downfall as a character to me is that she is just there to pull Sora back together and do some crazy deus ex machima to pull him out of the rare stuff that he cant (going according to plan if we follow the show's logic) do. \n\nc) Stephanie Dola - The other main character who's purpose is nothing but be exposed half naked every 4 minutes and be mocked off because of her stupidity. I have gotten slander here on MAL because apparently her role is much deeper in motivating Sora and what not if you go all philosophical with the fan boys. In reality its not and her contribution to the progression of the plot is about 0. \n\nEnjoyment\n\nWhere is the enjoyment supposed to come from this show? If its the games it did a poor job. You never get the sensation that the games are a challenge for any of the main characters because everything goes according to plan and they are never really under any concern due to Sora and Shiro's super Einstein like intellect. There is always something that saves them from defeat or something which gets really annoying by episode 3 or 4. \n\nLet me say that chess game in episode the span of episodes 4-5? (I maybe wrong) Is probably the worst thing you can ever watch since there is absolutely no logic behind it all and its just a complete out of thin air invention to win the game. The only game I really enjoyed where the last 2 episodes because the main characters where actually in a pinch it goes in the most predictable way of having the most useless character in the show do something. It all went according to the same generic running theme throughout the show that everything is going according to the super master plan that we won the game before we even start. How do people get any joy out of this is beyond me. \n\nThe core of the plot is really slow and its pretty much overshadowed by the fan service and stupidity of Stephanie who is pretty much just a guinea pig to try out stuff throughout the show. \n\nOverall \n\nIn the end I was really disappointed since I was looking forward to the show and all I got was just a slap in the face of how overrated, flawed and boring this show is some weeks in. The fan service outshines the plot and that is already a red flag. The plot already weak to begin with and all you get is boobs and stupidity with slow progression its not really ideal.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by javycane (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 25, 2014\n\nHaXXspetten\n\nRecommended\n\n 【1】 All bloodshed, war, and pillage is forbidden throughout the world.\n\n【2】 All disputes are to be resolved through the outcome of games.\n\n【3】 In games, wagers will be made on what both parties decide to be of equal value.\n\n【4】 Unless contrary to \"Three\", the game content and the things wagered do not matter.\n\n【5】 The challenged party has the right to decide the contents of the game.\n\n【6】 \"As per the Oath\", the wager will be unconditionally adhered to.\n\n【7】 All matters for group conflicts will be decided by a representative.\n\n【8】 If cheating is detected during a game, it will be regarded as a defeat.\n\n【9】 The above rules are\n\n...\n\nunconditionally everlasting, upheld in the name of God.\n\n【10】—— Everyone should get along while playing games.\n\nSo reads the Ten Commandments which make up the laws of the incredible world of No Game No Life.\n\nIf there is one anime that once and for all showcases that the end well and truly justifies the means when it comes to entertainment value, then it's got to be this one. Originally a light novel written by Kamiya Yuu, No Game No Life (or NGNL for short) is a series not quite like any other, mixing together numerous ordinary concepts into a not-so-ordinary and very refreshing story. It is not just about originality though, but the provided execution is absolutely fantastic as well, as this is one of the most addictive and over-the-top anime you'll ever come across.\n\n--Story--\n\nHow can anything seemingly so dumb be so damn smart?\n\nIn recent years there has been a fair share of anime following the concept of \"being trapped inside a video game with no way to escape it\", and it has been very successful. No Game No Life however takes the exact same idea and flips it upside down. This story is not about being trapped inside a game world, but rather instead it's about voluntarily being in a fantasy world which has its very foundation oriented around the concept of games. The only other anime I can think of that uses a somewhat similar idea is Mondaiji-tachi ga Isekai kara Kuru Sou Desu yo, but NGNL takes it one or two steps further, and more importantly does it around nine or ten levels better.\n\nThere was a legendary player team in the online gaming community named \"[ ]\" (pronounced \"Kūhaku\", or \"Blank\" in English) which was known for never ever losing to anyone, no matter which game they were playing. Their real-life identities however were unknown to the world, but as it turned out it consisted of a pair of NEET (Not in Education, Employment or Training) gamer siblings: 18 year old Sora and his 11 year old little sister Shiro. These two geniuses were completely fed up with the real world and didn't think of it as anything more than a shitty game, and therefore spent all their time in their room owning others in online games. That is to say before they got challenged online by a mysterious chess player who brought them to the very limits of their abilities before they could eventually manage to win. As a result, they got contacted by someone named Tet; the God of another world called Disboard, the ultimate paradise for gamers of Sora's and Shiro's caliber and he therefore invited them to come live in his world instead. And thus, the games began.\n\nIn the world of Disboard, there are a total of sixteen different races that have been granted the protection of the Ten Commandments, and are therefore the only ones worth mentioning. These races are seeded in order of magical strength, and at the very bottom of the ranking we find the race of Imanity, which is Disboard's equivalent to the human race (clearly a spinoff of the word \"humanity\"). However as shameful as being at the bottom of the food chain might be, that ranking was made before Sora and Shiro arrived as reinforcements.\n\nIn a nutshell, the story of No Game No Life is about the siblings' long-term plans of conquering the world by challenging others at games and using the Ten Commandments' wagers as winnings while (hopefully) maintaining [ ]'s 100% win record. Sounds simple enough, right? Well it's not.\n\nThe catch is that since the Ten Commandments make up the very structure of the world itself, combined with the fact that it's a supernatural world containing magic to begin with; what the games are, how they are played and what their consequences are is *completely* limitless. This anime can and will do anything and everything as long as the author can think it up in his head beforehand, and let me tell you: what he has managed to cook up is nothing short of spectacular. Seriously, the amount of creativity and pure awesomeness poured into the various game sessions throughout this anime should most definitely *not* be understated, and as a result NGNL has some of the best single individual episodes I've ever seen in my anime career.\n\nOf course that is not to say the grander, overarching story is any less impressive. Actually it manages to maintain the individual episode quality while still staying on track for the long-term plot in a very smooth manner of fashion, and as a result the anime never ever gets boring. It has a very high \"lowest level” so to speak, but it does still get a bit spiky as some episodes are a lot better than others, however that is a jump ranging from \"good\" to \"amazing\" rather than ever dipping down very much. You'll constantly be starved for more.\n\n--Characters--\n\nWhoever would have thought NEETs would be so neat?\n\nAs the 2-man protagonist team of the series, undoubtedly the vast majority of the focus in the character department is on Sora and Shiro themselves, and they're certainly not disappointing.\n\nSora is extremely charismatic and cunning. He uses tons of deceitful tactics and strategies planned out way in advance in order to direct the flow of events much more so than meets the eye at first glance. As he likes to say, no matter how the game turns out, his victory is already assured from the very beginning. Of course this does not mean he's the second coming of Light or Lelouch, as Sora has no sinister ulterior motives (other than perverted ones every so often) and instead is really a very humorous and enthusiastic person that just likes to have fun.\n\nShiro on the other hand looks like nothing more than a moe fanservice loli at first glance, and to some extent I cannot say that part is wrong per se. In case you didn't realize it this is an ecchi anime in the end. We're talking about very light ecchi here and nothing that ever feels forced but rather used for comedy instead, however you still shouldn't be shocked if you find some nudity and boob groping every once in a while. Now as far as Shiro herself is concerned, that does however not change the fact that there is a hell of a lot more to her than that. For one she's quite fun to listen to with her almost completely expressionless voice, yet very blunt choice of words. Also, in reality her level of genius is way above that one of her brother, but in a very different way. Shiro's mind works sort of like a supercomputer, capable of unmatched amounts of logical thinking and data storage at any given point. On the other hand this makes her less adaptable than Sora, however what this means is that the pair of them perfectly complement each other's weaknesses. Thus even if they might be defeatable on their own, when they play together they are almost invulnerable, hence why [ ] is always together as one... actually whenever they are out of each other's line of sight they start panicking and get seizures and god knows what else.\n\nThe supporting cast primarily consists of Stephanie Dola (or Dora, either works) whom at first also looks like the obligatory fanservice character but before long you'll realize that she's much more of a comic relief character... or rather the butt of everyone else's jokes. Now normally I might be a bit skeptical to that idea but this girl fills that role absolutely *perfectly*. Huge props to her voice actress I also have to add, she really did an awesome job expressing Stephanie's impulsive behaviour. There is also the ever so popular Jibril who is just all around awesome in every way, but I'll avoid talking about her as she is introduced later on in the story.\n\n--Art--\n\nNo you're not on drugs, it actually looks like that\n\nThe word \"colorful\" doesn't even begin to scratch the surface on this one. Animated by Madhouse, NGNL probably has the most vivid color scheme I've yet to come across in an anime and it is hard to put into words just what exactly it looks like. It has tons of purple and red everywhere and tends to use colors even for distinguishing details like shadows, outlines and similar. It's really the kind of thing you need to see for yourself to understand but it sure as hell stands out from the crowd.\n\nAs always when it comes to artwork, it is entirely a subjective matter and whether you like it or not is up to every viewer individually. Personally I really liked it though, it somehow fit the over-the-top environments and atmosphere of the series very well, but I would still have to say that had it been for any other anime it would probably just have come off as being really weird.\n\n--Sound--\n\nCan you feel that beat? Beating everyone at everything that is\n\nOn its own this was definitely the part which I thought about the least while I was actually watching the series, but when looking at it in retroperspective it's actually really solid.\n\nHere's the thing, the OP of NGNL never particularly blew me away but to be fair I mostly ended up skipping it all the time because I was so eager to get into the new episode every week so I could never really pay too much attention to it. The ED is better albeit still not amazing, although when the full version came out I found it a lot more enjoyable than I did during the anime itself.\n\nThat part asides though, the OST for the anime itself is one or two levels above that. Especially the music playing during some of the games themselves as well as the occasional epic speeches that occurs every once in a while during this anime have some very epic background tracks along with them.\n\nAs far as voice acting goes, many people will recognize the main seiyuu combi of Matsuoka Yoshitsugu and Kayano Ai making up Sora's and Shiro's respective roles. The first thing I noticed with this was that this is the exact same MC seiyuu coupling as that one of Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo, and just like Shiina in said anime, Shiro's voice is insanely husky and is almost like a whisper most of the time... in an adorable way of course. As far as Sora goes, more people will probably familiarize him with the fact that he has the same voice actor as Kirito from Sword Art Online, which might give some people the impression that NGNL is yet another anime which goes down the same route SAO did... which is definitely not the case.\n\nThey both make an absolutely solid performance in this case anyway, however to me the best voice acting in No Game No Life is the one done by Hikasa Yoko in her role as Stephanie. The role she has as the character constantly getting abused by the two siblings simply for their enjoyment (combined with the tsukkomi character she has to play for whenever their inner NEETs surface) results in her having numerous different comedy roles at the same time, yet Yoko absolutely nails them all every single time in an absolutely hilarious fashion.\n\n--Enjoyment--\n\n12x23 minutes never felt so short\n\nI'm just going to straight-up say that this is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable anime I've seen to date. Normally I don't like to watch series while they're currently airing very much, however I did it with this one and let me tell you waiting a full week for every new episode of this anime was painful. Excruciatingly so. This is not due to aspects such as constant cliffhangers or anything (although that also happens a few times) but simply due to how much fun every single episode is to watch. The concept of the anime as a whole is extremely appealing and interesting to follow, and due to the unlimited potential of the games themselves, every episode is completely different from the last one despite following the same ideals.\n\nThere's just so much charisma poured into the characters' over-the-top settings and it never fails to keep you hooked. Every single character is likable yet drastically different from one another. On top of all that the actual comedy part of NGNL is brilliant as well, including countless references to other anime series. I'm not sure exactly how it manages but somehow no matter which side of the show is present at any given moment, it delivers flawlessly every single time.\n\n--Overall--\n\nSo why aren't there any games like this in real life?\n\nEver since I first read the synopsis of this anime several months before it started airing, I immediately thought to myself: \"Hey, this sounds pretty awesome, wincest plus video games?\". Now as it turned out there wasn't very much in the way of wincest as this is solely sibling love, however what we got instead simply blew away pretty much all expectations I ever had. I did have a feeling that it would be something I would really like, but I don't think anyone who hadn't read the light novels ever imagined it to turn out this damn awesome.\n\nI love pretty much everything about this show, and that's not something I can say very often. From start to finish I don't think there was a single moment which I didn't enjoy, and that is something almost unheard of in anime. It's so versatile in the way that it's funny, original, charismatic, intelligent and just plain epic and awesome, all working in tandem. As a result, everything ends up being immensely satisfying.\n\nNow this first season covers up to the end of volume three of the original light novels, and at the current time (the anime just finished airing), there are six volumes released in Japan, so there's already plenty of content to adapt and hopefully season two won't be too far around the corner, although as always it will come down to sales numbers in the end.\n\nRegardless, it sure as hell needs a second season sooner rather than later, as we're all going to suffer from abstinence until then.\n\nGame Over..... for now at least........ hopefully\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by HaXXspetten (\n125\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJan 6, 2015\n\nMyhv\n\nRecommended\n\n I don't normally write reviews, mainly cause I don't think that many people will be interested in my totally subjective opinion, but this time I decided to make an exception. Mainly cause I can't stand to see so many people slamming this series with the same repeating arguments, completely ignoring the positives.\n\nAs I've said, I have very much subjective and in many ways probably biased love for the series. I assume it's mainly because it saved me from the rot of meaningless flashy series, where fan service replaces story and various \"grabs\" are there instead of plot twists. But isn't this virtually the\n\n...\n\nsame? I have to strongly disagree.\n\nFirstly, lets get the initial impressions out of the way. Art here has a nice modern touch, clean graphics, tight animations and it's nice to see designers using after processing to add a style, not to obscure shabby production quality. Although I think style overall suits modern day setting more than fantasy world, making opening scene and city battle at the end of season most visually impressive. \n\nCharacter design is the only complaint I can rise here, mainly among humans. Not that it's bad, but somewhat samey. Good thing we have 15 more races to look at.\n\nNow, regarding the setting itself, I kinda love it. On surface it looks uninspired: yet another parallel world where main character gets wisped away to, fantasy races, magic, dragons and villains. Oh and there's a princess also, who falls in love with main character, but she's kind of tsundere. Oh and they live in her castle.\n\nBut that's what makes this one of my favorite series: the ability to take the most overused and boring setting, so dull, that Le Blanc de La Vallière, Louise Françoise might confuse it for her homeworld, and twist it in to something crazy and interesting. \n\nYes, we had anime about games before, be it SAO, Log Horison, Ragnarok or //hack, but they all tried to bring real life in to game, while NGNL does the opposite: it brings the game back in to life. If anything, it's closer to Kaiji, just less depressing and unfair.\n\nBut what I really like about the subject, is that unlike majority of game related or themed anime, this one manages to appeal to gamers as a whole, instead of pandering to or focusing on Asian aspects of gaming, specifically their mmos and VNs. Yes, tehre's still influence, but it's not so absolute. I don't mind watching things like SAO and Log Horizon to better understand tropes and intricacies of Asian gaming, but for once I want something I can just enjoy and relate to.\n\nIt saddens me how few gamers I see around here, or at least it seems so, cause how else would one explain such widespread misunderstanding of setting and main focuses of the series. For me it's an amazing, impossible world, for once created by gamers, not just for gamers. It's as MCs said in the first episode: real world has no clearly defined rules or objectives and everyone makes whatever moves they want, i.e. just a shitty game.\n\nIt's a fantasy of any gamer to be unbeatable at everything, so it makes easy for me to relate to MCs. They also manage to avoid the oh so common trope that being transported in to a different world makes you slow and docile. MCs get right to business abusing the world for their own gain and enjoyment and it's a breath of fresh air from typical goody two shoes I will protect you OJSB of a MC that we have so often. \n\nBut the one thing that can make or break series for me is humor. Will it make me laugh or cringe? Will I be bored enough to check how much of an episode is left? Well, NGNL managed to do something anime has failed for me since Lucky Star: it made me literally laugh out loud every episode, to the point where my room mates would come over to check if I'm going insane or not.\n\nIt's hard to pinpoint exactly what made me like it so much, probably the combination of verbal humor with spot on body humor, references , selfish attitude and in-jokes between the siblings. That, combined with the general gaming theme made it easy to digest and relate.\n\nIf one would take the plot and development at face value, it would on impress much, a rather generic battle to save humanity and prove that they are not the weakest. But you need to move away from typical anime tropes to realize that it's not about humanity, beating the god or any other vague \"greater good\". This anime is really just about two siblings, gamers, who are having fun in a world they understand very well. Everything they do is to advance their own agenda.\n\nSomething I do have to mention though. Sound, overall, was serviceable, but what annoyed me the most was soundtrack. It felt... uninspired. Both in terms of opening/ending and music during the show itself. One would think that by this time directors understand the advantages of memorable music, but here it was mostly generic fantasy/fighting anime scores, completely alien to the nature of the show. I strongly feel that having some metal/electronic (or better both!) mash-ups would of suited gaming theme a lot more. Not to mention that they have quite a few gadgets along with them, yet they rarely use them for anything than taking notes or reading books.\n\nOne final thing I need to cover is fan service. To be completely honest here, first time I've watched the series, I did not notice it at all. Considering that I'm not a fan of it normally, it was rather strange. It took me a second viewing to realize what was different. It fitted, which happens never. Both MCs lived in a world exposed to ungodly amounts of it, to the point where it became somewhat of a background thing. As a result they were using it for their own entertainment, as opposed of ham-fisted\"accidents\" that plague anime nowadays. It was also employed by them for their own need, be it to tease or to distract, as well as a nice addition the their, honestly, rather unhealthy relationship. I can only wish that, if we have to have fan service, it would be done in similar, organic way. \n\nAnd there you have it, this is why I don't normally write reviews, I tend to get carried away. As a conclusion, I would say that NGNL is often misunderstood for mediocre anime riding on populat tropes, but I see it as an amazing melding of Asian and western cultures. We learned to enjoy Asian quirks and their way of life, but this one hits it close to home, to a closer culture. \n\nIt's a must see anime for anyone, but you might not understand what it's trying to do, but that's normal with anime, isn't it? And if you consider yourself a gamer, it's a wonderful treat, something that rarely happens outside of youtube.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Myhv (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 16, 2014\n\nraindrop\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n [contains spoilers]\n\nMake no mistake, No Game No Life is built to be a blockbuster. Madhouse adapting \"one of those\" wildly successful isekai light novel series made sense considering their generally poor commercial performance as of late. And NGNL, a blitzkrieg of dastardly clever action and outrageous gags, as unsettling as it is original, certain delivers a worthy blockbuster, but not without significant shortcomings.\n\nThe anime centers around the Blank siblings - Sora and Shiro: brother and sister, two shut-in NEETs on Earth, but certain victors in a new absurdist world, whose ambitions and exploits, leave their adversaries confounded and awed at the same damn time. Ostensibly,\n\n...\n\nthe pair could be written off as a simple gary stu/mary sue pairing. By technicality they are, but they’re far from boring or cliche characters like many that fit that designation due to how the series presents their NEET qualities. Both brother and sister come off as legitimately fun leads, with flashy traits that resemble iconic characters from other well-known anime, novels, or games without feeling like standard self-inserts. \n\nIn the first episode, our pair of gaming prodigies are whisked into a new isekai world, Disboard, by its enigmatic God, Tet and by the fourth, they are the rulers of Elkia, the last kingdom of Imanity, the human race. NGNL hits the ground running and doesn’t let up for a second. The worldbuilding and plot development resembles the progression of an RPG: minor games precede major ones with interludes in between. Nearly the entirely of the seasons’ 276 minute runtime can be neatly categorized into plotting, games, or \"breaks in action\" - which generally involve harassing Steph or all the females taking baths while Sora sits back on the partition as hilarity ensues. This oversexualization and fanservice is responsible for some of the funniest moments of the season and serves to enhance the over-the-top, volatile energy of the show. \n\nNGNL’s framework makes it easy to overstate the otaku and gamer escapism and gratification, which itself is offputting for those who have anathema to the common isekai mainstays of \"wish fulfillment\" and \"fanservice\" while indiscriminately associating these to inherently tasteless anime without a second thought. This line of logic downplays not only downplays the consistent insanity of the action, but also the nuance of the overarching premise behind the parodical, ludicrous nature of the series. \n\nThere is a certain poetic justice captured by NGNL in its portrayal of how NEETs and hikikomori, who Japanese society would deem outcasts or losers regardless of their gaming talent, become monarchs, harem ringleaders, and ultimately winners. Much of NGNL’s charm is more readily appreciated by seasoned otaku, who embrace, and even long for, the taboos that could potentially come with an isekai power trip. After all, it’s a show for them. There are many NEET isekai series, some tone-deaf edgefests and others indiscernible carbon copies of each other, but NGNL separates itself with minutae that captures the essence of what it means to be a NEET. The jokes, including the hypersexual ones, border on gut-wrenchingly hilarious for them and uncomfortable for almost everyone else. The chemistry between cast members generates at least a few memorable one-liners and interactions every episode. The constant stream of clever allusions ranging from Skyrim to Laputa to Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei to ICO are bound to elicit grins when noticed. \n\nDespite being an underdog story about NEETs in disguise, but from the beginning it’s evident that all Blank does is win (no DJ Khaled) in this new world - because after all, to beat a RPG you gotta win against every boss. Thus the goal of the series develops into a making the viewer hooked on HOW they win each and every game. While there are brilliant highs, towards the end of the season, the state of the games have gotten to the point where the constant victory really does begin to dull the suspense to the point where the result of the final game itself came of as anticlimactic, bordering on deus ex machina. Nonetheless, it would be ingenuous to not expect gaps of logic, plot armor, and minor plot holes, but none of them are particularly questionable or bothersome enough to reduce the quality of the series at large. \n\nOn the other side, the highlight is the sudden Shiratori game with Jibril, unsurprisingly the only character who can keep up with the Blank siblings' craziness, where the intensity and cleverness of each response ratcheting up to another level. It was the first and only moment where it felt like our heroes could actually LOSE while we watch hydrogen bombs and stars explode because of a fucking simple children's word game - all while laughing (hysterically, I might add) at the sheer preposterousness of it all. Blank’s other challengers haven’t had the same spark as Jibril (who, in classic RPG fashion, later becomes an ally) - and it makes one think they really could use an equally insane foil or antagonist to bring out their best. \n\nThe substance of NGNL itself is its style, and it works wonders thanks to its burlesque tone. The balance is extreme, but not much of a departure from Imaishi and Masaaki-directed works. What makes NGNL is different is how specific it is, how every stratagem is explained and everything happens for a reason. Which is why for NGNL to truly connect on an emotional level, it has to specifically dedicate time towards making the viewer care about the characters and the world they find themselves in. It struggles in this regard. Much of the direct characterization throughout these first twelve episodes of NGNL suffers from ubiquitous lack of meaningful development. To an extent, this was to be be expected due to the nature of the series, but some of the attempted subplots fall flat because of this. \n\nSteph is the most prominent contributor, because she serves as a foil for Sora and Shiro and should be an easiest character to relate to on a basic level (basically she's a fucking normie). However, her sobbing about her grandfather, the disgraced former king of who gambled his land away in hopes of future prosperity, is sappy at best and annoying at worst. Her inner back-and-forth of whether to trust Sora as a leader or not was painfully half-baked, contrived, and thoughtless. Moreover, it’s difficult to care too much about Izuna’s inner struggle about her sense of duty or Fiel’s bond to Kurami when they’re explored for a few scenes and pass by like a floating piece of debris in a hurricane. This can even apply to NGNL's more compelling and fun characters: take Jibril for example, a deserved fan favorite who shifts between (literally) drooling over the prospect of gaining precious knowledge to reminiscing about the days where she could indulge in her psychopathic tendencies of slaughtering anyone in her way. Sora and Shiro themselves have a quirk where their usually badass, composed personalities become useless and complete wrecks when they’re away from each other. \n\nThis tendency to just throw schizoid personality traits out there and hope they stick is the most telling sign that thus far, NGNL has abandoned even barebones exposition. Random behavior is dismissed with the notion that every character acts with some form of inherent spontaneity instead of possessing a fluid train of thought. These developmental aspects are double-edged swords that inject off the wall personality to the series that adds to the fantasy, while also hinder the viewer from taking NGNL's actual narrative or the aforementioned subplots too seriously. We’re left in the dark about relationships, individual vulnerabilities, and motivations. By consequence, a lot of the details dull the quality for this individual season but set up for reveals and more backstory later on. \n\nMuch of the worldbuilding and characterization itself is represented through the heightened sense of verticality, with rapidfire cut changes. This, along with Madhouse’s high-contrast neon color palette and quirky artwork distinguishes Disboard as one of the most picturesque, eccentric, and effervescent isekai settings I've ever seen animated. Often, right after heavy action sequences full of zooming movements and aerial shots, the cinematography shifts to juxtapose our larger-than-life characters to an even more larger-than-life world. This imbalance creates a lingering sense that the characters are small and caged, giving the viewers the sense that someone (remember Tet?) is constantly watching, and there is much much more to the game that is yet to come. Furthermore, the voice acting especially for Sora, Shiro, and Jibril is bonkers and felt incredibly fitting for their characters. The BGM itself isn’t a highlight, but it’s solid throughout - playful or intense when it needs to be, whereas Konomi Suzuki’s opening, This Game, with twinkling pianos and soaring vocals sets the mood, and I’m definitely going to try to learn (and fail) how to play it. \n\nIt’s undeniable that NGNL has the scope and potential to be truly massive in every sense of the word. Seriously, the setup has every indication that this world-building could lead to a inordinately expansive and nuanced universe, much like other long-running light novel series such as Index, Spice and Wolf, or Mondaiji (similar premise also withstanding). Sora and Shiro are bent on challenging god, and you have every reason to believe they will. Still, it's disappointing that the season peaked at episode six, the shiratori match with Jibril and by the twelfth episode, much of the novelty has already begun wearing off. Yet despite the minor speed bump, the sense that there is so much potential with the world of Disboard never fizzles out and we’re reminded of that with how the first season ends - with a cliffhanger materializing from thin air. Zero fucking warning on that, by the way. With many more volumes to adapt, things can only get bigger; whether they get better has yet to be seen. \n\nTL;DR: read the whole review pussy btw it’s a ostentatiously fun/bizzare show that’s probably not for everyone if they just don’t get the gratification/fanservice/always winning/self-parody/otaku power fantasy stuff. still, mostly it’s functionally a prologue and maybe the first few bosses of this bigger NGNL rpg that sets the script for following seasons/volumes so don't expect it to have any real juicy plot meat if you know what I'm sayin because it's served up undercooked here. but i can’t say this enough: the shiratori game with Jibril was fucking awesome.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by raindrop (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 29, 2014\n\nMarlyTT\n\nNot Recommended\n\n -Spoilers Ahead-\n\nHere's the obligatory premise of the show for this review because I'm assuming you can't read the Synopsis up there due to allergy or something: Sora and Shiro have tremendous gaming skills and are bored with the regular world. A message arrives for the siblings, and when they open their message, they are stunned to see the scenery around them change to a world they had never encountered before. They've been summoned by Tet to... \n\nYes, the premise is pretty much a carbon copy of Mondaiji-tachi. In fact, it's so similar that I had to actually check when the respective light novels were released.\n\n...\n\nThey're both about incredibly talented kids getting sucked into a different world because they're too special for boring human world, and they play \"games.\" Even the visuals are strikingly similar in that they're both incredibly colorful. But hey, you can't exactly be always original- Technically speaking, every show could be considered a carbon copy of some other show that came before, and being uncreative doesn't really detract from the quality of the show. That's not the problem here. The visuals and music are fine too, although it does overuse that one track a lot when the MC explains his plan. \n\nBut the visuals are the least of its problems- The two main characters, Sora and Shiro, are simply put, Stus. Everyone loves Stus as main characters, so why not? Izayoi from Problem Children was a huge Stu too, beating the shit out of everything with next to no effort, and these two are no different. They're just incredibly talented at everything and their only supposed weakness is that they have to be together at all times. Thankfully this weakness is actually never an issue except when it's relevant, and outside of that, it's played for comedic effects. And even if it ever would pose a serious problem, it's usually resolved by one of the two planning something out before the weakness actually happened in the first place, so it's just a pretend label. It doesn't make them any less of Stus. Unfortunately, many people seem to think this is actually a valid weakness, and therefore, doesn't make them Stus. It really isn't. \n\nAt least they're not Tatsuya, right? \n\nThey're not the only problem, of course. Stephanie Dora is this incredibly obnoxious character who pretty much exists for a comic relief. In fact, literally every episode involves making fun of this character for being stupid, and it never ends. So much that even the fanbase now associates her name with the term \"stupidity.\" Making fun of a character for being stupid is funny the first time. Maybe the second and third. Not so much after when it becomes an established fact. \"Ha, the sky is blue! So funny!\"\n\nAnd then there's Jibril. Her introduction to the series is just so terribly done that it's almost offensive. There's no foreshadowing whatsoever to her existence, and when it's brought up, it just turns into \"Oh, Steph was stupid. Guess that's why she didn't tell us about this character that didn't exist until this point in plot.\" And after she's introduced, she's mostly written as an exposition character that just explains all the world building for the watchers instead of letting the viewers figure things out by themselves. This also serves to mediate Steph's complete uselessness as a character because the author realized it wouldn't be a nice idea to have a recurring side character whose only purpose was to be a comic relief. \n\nI think simply claiming they're Stus isn't really enough to convince anyone, so I'll be more elaborate. But I can't exactly explain that in detail without explain this other thing. And that other thing is the title's namesake; Games! \n\nMaybe the series was trying to be clever with its title \"No Game No Life\" because there hardly is anything that can be categorized as an actual \"game\" in this series. The biggest problem with these so-called games can be summarized like this: \"Oops, I win.\"\n\nSince most of the episodes have games in them, I'll just explain how each was handled- \n\nFirst episode doesn't explain how Sora won the game. He just did, and you're supposed to accept it. Third episode is a chess game where the rules don't really exist. It's supposed to technically play like a chess, but there really are no established rules- If you're the main character and give a speech, apparently you're rigged to win. Am I supposed to be impressed yet? Fourth episode doesn't have a game, but it breaks character- Sora and Shiro are supposed to be scared of crowds, but in this episode, they get over it pretty quickly as if that was never a problem in the first place. Then they proceed to give an incredibly cliche speech about how the weak can become strong. A speech that's not even really reflective, since Sora and Shiro were never \"weak\" in terms of their gaming prowess, or inspiring since the speech was practically nothing. The entirety of fifth episode is Steph being called an idiot, and a sequence of games that just follows what the series did with the first episode. Sora just \"wins\" them all, and the few ones that he does explain how he won, is just completely out of some puzzle book. Brilliant. \n\nSixth episode is where Jibril is introduced, and it's sadly considered one of the \"better\" episodes in the series. The game here could have been well done, but it's really just a mess. The game's victory hinges on the fact that Jibril does not know about the planet's structure. How could have Sora known this? What if Tet's magic world planet had a different structure from Earth? This is even before Sora had access to Elkia's library, so he wouldn't have known that wasn't common knowledge. Furthermore, Elkia isn't exactly the most knowledgeable nation- He claims that he supposedly figured out in the middle of a game by seeing how she reacted, but she could've been just as easily pretending. But it just so happens that she doesn't know about his win condition. It's a victory that just happened with assumptions and guesses, and apparently this is supposed to make the MC look like a genius. Really?\n\nBreaking off a bit from this pretend game nonsense, seventh episode manages to be the best episode in the series- Instead of Sora pretending he's smart over something he got completely lucky over, the audience get decently written characterization and not as forced exposition. That about sums up every compliment I had for this show. Everything afterwards just builds up to a very disappointing finale- Though, not before informing the watchers that Shiro is definitely helpless without Sora. Except not really, because Sora is still there, you see. What happens is that Shiro is supposed to play a piece on a board game that she can't see. This board game was being played by Sora and an another character. But apparently since she's a \"genius,\" she can predict where he's going to place the pieces, and know exactly where to put it. Except that, the game wasn't called Solitaire. I'm sorry, but it's logically impossible to exactly predict the game state of Othello from knowing just half of the game. Of course the show doesn't explain how this was done. It's just brushed off as Shiro being a genius and knowing everything about Sora, and that was the key to victory. It's all the more offensive when you realize that the victory of this game is what also later helps Sora to win the final game in the series in a domino effect. \n\nThe finale attempts to make Steph seem relevant by having her pull the final trigger. Too bad she didn't actually do anything. Sora and Shiro planned her to do it! Genius! This last episode's supposed \"moral lesson\" is completely insensible too. It keeps repeating the line \"when was the last time you had fun playing a game?\" If people are putting something big like continents and people's lives at stake, it'd be borderline psychopathic to find fun from playing a game putting that at risk. I don't get the \"moral lesson\" here. Is this show telling me to completely disregard everything except having fun? I guess Russian Roulette was a popular party game too. Possible bullets to the head? YES! GOTY! 10/10 IGN. Why aren't you having fun? Are you stupid or something?\n\nThis particular game is also flawed in that their winning strategy also hinges on the fact that the enemy does not notice something that they later claim to be able to notice. Good thing they didn't the first time! Those stupid warbeasts! Even though an entire continent is at stake, they can't even put up that much of a caution! Again, this is not planning. It's luck. Sora gambles, and wins. You can't just win the lottery, make a smug face, and call yourself a genius. But this is what this show does. Every single time. It's not even pretentious in a sense that it's trying to do something remotely clever- Because it's not even fucking remotely clever. \n\nI also don't understand why Sora/Shiro are separate characters. Shiro is just literally Sora, without the smug attitude, being a fanservice bait, and doesn't have much of a personality outside of being incredibly clingy. The show also plays out their relationship far too much to the point that it's creepy. But then again, that's what these shows seem to do these days: Incest is ok, because they're not actually blood-related siblings. This show also constantly hammers in the point about how \"Blanks can never lose\" and that both siblings make up Blanks to an extent that it's incredibly annoying. Of course they can never lose- They're the fucking MCs and the plot bends itself backwards to LET them win. Furthermore, you pretty much know that Sora and Shiro will win no matter what. They always bet something to the point that if they lose, the series would probably be over, so you know that they can't lose. There is no sense of anticipation or whatsoever. Then after winning through some poorly explained method which this show constantly nudges you about how clever it was being, Sora just makes that same fucking smug grin. \n\nSo yes. The biggest problems with the show supposedly about games is the games themselves, and the characters playing them. The series also constantly teases about how exciting things were before Tet became the absolute God. It's almost like it's self-aware. Lovely. \n\nThis series could've been better if they didn't constantly play these games where cheating is more encouraged than making actual strategies within the game's boundaries. See, games are fun to watch because you want to see what the characters can do within their own boundaries to actually win in a clever manner. It's also fun to watch because you don't really know who will win. But due to the whole retarded \"Cheating is fine as long as it's not caught\" rule in the show, the author is given the freedom to not write anything remotely intelligent. All he needs to do is just say Sora won because he did something that was outside of game's design and that just made him win despite the fact that it would be near impossible in practice. And hopefully it's just as impossible for this show to get a second season.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by MarlyTT (\n15\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 1, 2014\n\nstu556\n\nNot Recommended\n\n In short: Low-brow pandering garbage. \n\nThe entirety of the show exists to facilitate the main character, Sora, in his traverses through a graphene-thin plot-composite synthesized from recycled tropes, clichés, and genre-hangups that not only weigh down the show and story but comprise the majority of what little weight the show has. \n\nIn attempting to make Sora more than run-of-the-mill, the writers marginalised the remaining characters to make room for their protagonist's greatly inflated ego: Steph and Jibril are reduced to idiots (who were very boring), Clammy is relegated to a spot as half-baked rival (or something, she was even more boring), and Shiro plays the\n\n...\n\nco-starring role as a heroic/silent doormat (okay she did get one good episode, but otherwise you could replace her with a cardboard cut out), all for the purpose of time-wasting fan service and to make Sora look cool by comparison. \n\nThe rest of show is hardly worth talking about. \n\nThe animation is from last year (or what they'd be calling \"last year\" last year) and the background music and OP/ED are as forgettable as they are serviceable. \n\nI've certainly seen worse shows (I'm looking at you Mirai Nikki) but that doesn't really mean much. \n\nThe worst part was that this was what I figured the shows was going to be like, but it would have been nice to have been wrong. \n\nI thought the shows was actually clever at first, creatively turning well known games on their heads. \n\nUnfortunately, the writers spent most of the time stroking their egos rather than chins.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by stu556 (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 26, 2014\n\nKane-san\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n No Game No Life is a clear example for the anime community of overconfidence. It's a story of Sora and Shiro, an expert gaming duo, sent to another world where everything is settled through games. While this may appear to be simply following the hype of Sword Art Online as other animes have done, this is actually a much more advanced and original premise than meets the eye. \n\nUnfortunately, the shows only aspect in its favor is the story's usage of different and unique games in order to settle disputes. The rest of the anime leaves much to be desired, simply applying clear attempts to\n\n...\n\ngain popularity and providing poorly written characters to drag along the plot.\n\nConsidering there is not much to discuss as far as the story without providing spoilers, the most important reason as to why I do not recommend this anime would be due to its excuse for characters.\n\nStarting off, we have our 1st protagonist, Sora. Sora is Shiro's older step-brother who is practically designed to be unlikable. While many anime characters are perverted in nature, Sora is just down right despicable. Using his skill as a gamer he forces a girl to fall in love with him and with the help of Shiro, proceeds to provide her with belittling comments and sexual harassment on a level that can never be justified. Furthermore, rather than actually establishing a unique and developed character for Sora, he's written as a clear Lelouch Lamperouge copy, mimicking the star of Code Geass' intellectual prowess without having the same charisma that makes a fan of Code Geass love the protagonist. It's this sloppy writing that exposes the empty characters we are seeing on screen.\n\nMoving onto our next gaping flaw in No Game No Life we have Shiro, Sora's younger and impressively less likable sister. While Sora at least had some semblance of a character, Shiro is just a part of the show. She does things that help the plot sure, but she's not deep in the slightest. Her only noticeable trait aside from being a gamer is that she is overly protective of her brother. She constantly gets worked up when another female interacts with Sora, going as far as to take one girl's clothing, including underwear, and having her dress up as a dog before being tied to a pole in front of the townspeople. It's these types of moments that make No Name No Life so mediocre. It's having our main female character be abusive to another relevant member of the cast without any sort of reprimanding that makes her painful to even watch. Such actions on her part make her extremely unlikable and unfortunately this is her only aspect to her character with noting. Other than this, she's just a piece of cardboard that can somehow speak.\n\nNo Game No Life is not the greatest anime of all time; in fact its not even good. Quite honestly, this is one of the most overrated animes I've ever seen. If you want to see people have an engaging battle of the minds, watch either Death Note or Code Geass. If you want to watch overly unnecessary fan-service and some of the worst written characters in anime, only then can I ever recommend No Game No Life. While the games themselves are an engaging part of the overall experience, the rest is a train wreck that shows that a good concept still needs strong writing to be successful.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kane-san (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 1, 2014\n\nTheDeedsOfMen\n\nNot Recommended\n\n \"There's no way to know the rules or the goal, yet there are 7 billion players making whatever moves they want. There are no parameters and no way to even know the genre. This world is just a crappy game.\"\n\n ‒ Sora, No Game No Life\n\nIs it really that bad? Real life is a wide open sandbox game with the most realistic physics and graphics in existence. \n\nNo Game No Life is a show that is full of games and tactics. Just one problem: they don't work. And I don't mean some small loopholes here and there. The very foundation of the tactics requires knowing\n\n...\n\nthings that are beyond realistic human knowledge. As a result, there is zero tension in this show. This is not Kasparov vs Deep Blue, this is playing against a psychic who can list every move you will make before the game has even begun. \n\nThe premise is already ridiculous. A pair of NEET shut-in siblings, Sora and Shiro, are known online as invincible players who have never lost in any game whatsoever, no matter the genre or how luck-based the game is. \n\n...Yes, really. That isn't an exaggeration; they are completely invincible.\n\nOver the course of the show, the viewer learns how they achieve this: by being omniscient. They know how anyone will react in any situation. They know what moves their opponent will make without seeing the game board. They know what words their opponent will use in a word game. They can figure out the inner workings of a video game the first time they are playing. They know how flipped coins will land. \n\n\"There is no such thing as luck in this world. Rules, prerequisites, psychological states... There are any number of invisible factors that combine to produce an unpredictable but inevitable result. The victor of a game is decided before it even begins. There is no chance.\"\n\n ‒ Sora explaining why his tactics work\n\n...Hang on a second. If the result is \"unpredictable,\" then that is what normal people usually mean by luck. When people say that e.g. poker has luck, they are not referring to some quantum fluctuations but simply the lack of knowledge of the order of the cards. So while it's a nice play on semantics, it does very little to actually justify Sora's tactics. For him there is nothing unpredictable.\n\nHow exactly are we supposed to emulate their tactics in real life? We can't, can we? The whole appeal in something like Liar Game is that the tactics actually work for actual human beings. Of course there is no limit to what you can do in a piece of fiction if the author makes a character omniscient, but where is the fun in watching something like that? Calling it wish fulfillment is an understatement.\n\nSo if it isn't about tactics, what is the show really about? Fanservice with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the skull. Bath scenes, breast grabs, tentacles, incest, animal girl fetishes, and obsession over a 11-year-old's panties should come as no surprise, but in addition we have nipple-erasing magic, boob-enlarging magic, and dragging a practically naked girl through the streets on a leash as \"the dog for the day.\" \n\nNeedless to say, if you aren't into nonstop fanservice, it gets tedious really fast. Even in the middle of a game, the characters are just as interested in fanservice as winning. The jokes are all about boobs, panties, and the like. The dialogue includes such gems as \"I'm a healthy young man, you know? I've got sexual needs, and sexual needs, and sexual needs! And even sexual needs!\" The show is trying to appeal to the most primitive aspects in our savannah monkey brains, assuming that awkwardly shoving mammary glands at the viewer is enough to constitute a well-written show.\n\nThe show is also full of references. It could work in theory, but too often the references feel so arbitrary that they break the flow of the scenes. For example, what does Legend of the Galactic Heroes have to do with a harem-themed first-person shooter (now there's a natural combo to begin with)? Nothing, but they just couldn't find a way to shoehorn it in otherwise. We get an endless flood of these references, as if ticking boxes on some checklist. Where's the fun in that? It feels like a calculated effort rather than a natural creative product, as if the writers were reading marketing surveys and trend analysis charts while watching 5-second Youtube clips of famous games and anime.\n\nStory: 3\n\nAnyway, back to the plot. Sora and Shiro are cast into a fantasy world where everything is decided by games, courtesy of the local god, Tet. They quickly decide that they don't even want to return to Earth and instead want to become #1 in this world by beating everyone, Tet included. \n\nWhy? To help end oppression and suffering?\n\n...No, of course not. What were you thinking? It's to increase their harem and satisfy their fetishes. This is why taking over the kingdom of animal girls is a top priority.\n\nAny politics or social commentary is handled in the most superficial way possible, reduced to little more than a footnote. I assume there wouldn't have been enough time for bouncing boobs otherwise. Sure, they talk about the weak defeating the strong with their wisdom, but they just leave it at that. Now, guess what, it's easy to say you can beat the strong if you are omniscient. How about you demonstrate realistic means to achieve it?\n\nAnd what was wrong with Earth anyway? In the quote I mentioned earlier, Sora called it a crappy game because there's no way to know the rules or the goal, but is it really any different for this fantasy world? It may revolve around games, but there is no truly universal or objective goal there either. It's just a place with different laws of physics.\n\nBy the way, the plot is also left severely unfinished, so don't expect any real conclusion. \n\nThe following subsections are part of the story, but they deserve their own categories.\n\nThe games:\n\nAh yes, the main selling point of the show. I honestly liked some of the smaller games, such as the modified rock-paper-scissors and \"when will this bird take off,\" but the alleged main attractions not so much. Many of them aren't particularly tactical to begin with, and the remaining ones are won through simply knowing things you can't realistically know.\n\nFirst-person shooter:\n\nThey can perfectly decipher the movement patterns of the NPCs the first time they are playing, as well as how their opponent will react. I mean, really: they predict both of these up to a few dozen pixels so that they can line a shot that they planned minutes in advance. Oh, and this FPS game is harem-themed, so much time and effort will be spent on trying to strip people by shooting their clothes. Predictably enough.\n\nMaterialization shiritori:\n\nHoping that the other player will use a specific word simply because you used it at one point... The show itself acknowledges that this was a gamble. So one question: if the success of the protagonists is built on luck, why are we supposed to believe they are geniuses? Oh, and it's completely natural that this fantasy world has similar laws of physics to ours, down to the subatomic level. After all, that's what fantasy worlds are known for.\n\nOthello:\n\nThe board becomes invisible, but a third party can join mid-game and figure out where all the pieces are by guessing all the moves taken so far. Sounds legit.\n\nChess:\n\nChess is a game known for its deep strategy. Well, we can't have any of that, so instead it's played by giving the pieces motivational speeches. And by speeches, I mean lines like: \n\n\"The one true, unchanging righteousness in this world is cuteness! Cute makes right!\"\n\n\"By my authority as king, anyone who fights valiantly in this battle will earn the right to bang any woman they like!\"\n\nImagine if Lelouch was giving a speech to his revolutionary force, and instead of appealing to justice he would praise cuteness and promise women as war loot. Indeed, the problem here is not so much that the protagonists are omniscient but rather that the game isn't particularly strategic to begin with, if you can even call this a legit game. Sora, if you dislike the real world because the rules are vague, why is this chess game not a problem?\n\nAnd did the soldiers even get their women afterwards? Sora, you cheap bastard.\n\nCoin Flip:\n\n...Yeah. There is actually a twist to this too, but it doesn't make it any more plausible.\n\nThe setting:\n\nThe setting makes no sense even within its own rules. Tet has set in place ten pledges that supposedly tell everything about how the world and its games are governed. I'll just copy-paste them here:\n\n1. All murder, war, and robbery is forbidden in this world. \n\n2. All conflict in this world will be resolved through games.\n\n3. In games, each player will bet something that they agree is of equal value. \n\n4. As long as it doesn't violate pledge three, anything may be bet, and any game may be played. \n\n5. The challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game. \n\n6. Any bets made in accordance with the pledges must be upheld. \n\n7. Conflicts between groups will be conducted by designated representatives with absolute authority. \n\n8. Being caught cheating during a game is grounds for an instant loss. \n\n9. In the name of god, the previous rules may never be changed. \n\n10. Let's all have fun and play together!\n\nIt's easy to guess that there's no way such a short and vague set of rules can work in practice. And indeed, it turns out the authors simply can't handle them with any kind of consistency or in-universe plausibility, and any attempts to explain these problems away simply result in ruining the whole point of the setting and making the world's inhabitants look like imbeciles. Let me be a rules lawyer here for a while because apparently nobody in this fantasy world is. \n\n1) \"Everything is decided by games\"? Nah.\n\nNobody can force you to do anything unless you agreed to it in a game? Wrong. Guess what constitutes a group for rule 7 when it comes to countries? Race, as in species. Apparently you don't have to lose any game to be subject to the whims of this representative of absolute authority. He can bet all your land or even your life by betting the race piece. By the way, none of this is included in the pledges, so it's an implicit rule the author added to keep the story going.\n\nThis pretty efficiently ruins the setting, which is presented as a situation where the most talented can take charge of their own lives without having to fear violence or theft. But in reality, each race is living under authoritarian rule where you can lose your life on a whim due to no fault of your own. I know Tet made this system to replace genocidal wars, but was this the best he could come up with?\n\n\"But you can just challenge the representative to a game to take over!\" Nope, he can just throw an impossible game at you. And everyone who is not the representative would face a massive risk, which would strain society's capacity to function.\n\nAlso, banning robbery doesn't sound fair after you realize how arbitrary ownership is. Some people start with no coins to their name and others are living comfortably in their palaces. Tet, have you ever heard of this guy called Karl Marx? Look him up. That being said, there's nothing forcing people to agree to any transactions or acknowledge any existing currency, so they could simply have the rich starve to death if they liked.\n\n2) People are too often acting as if the pledges did not exist\n\nPeople are too often acting normally, as if the rules did not exist. People go to work as usual and obey the law and the government as usual. We are presented with a society that by all sense shouldn't work the way it does. You can't have both \"everything is decided by games\" and normal society at the same time. If the representative can achieve this... well, then it just ruins the setting, like I was saying.\n\nIn this world there is even hereditary slavery. Why not run away? Of course not, they will beat you up... oh, wait. Also, it can't be that they have gambled away their freedom because it's hereditary. You might try to say, \"The representative can just order them to be slaves.\" Not when the slaves are of another race, and it would destroy any shred of fairness these rules have left.\n\nAnd some countries are apparently democracies. I suppose if the representative can be two people, it can also be an institution... I guess. I'm probably giving way too much credit here; it's more likely the writers forgot about the setting again. \n\n3) Why do people agree to slanted games in the first place?\n\nThe biggest head-scratcher of all. Your country doesn't have to lose territory. Just don't agree to any slanted games. Are they all complete imbeciles? If you are challenged, you can likewise simply choose games where you are sure to win.\n\nWhy didn't the cabinet ministers refuse when Sora asked them to play a game where he wins by default? Yeah, just try to wrap your head around that one. Apparently you can just force people to lose by default. If this is something the representative can do, he could simply order them without playing a game, unless there is some kind of ridiculously specific implicit clause somewhere. \n\n...Screw this, it's obvious the writers just didn't care.\n\nCharacters: 2\n\nSora and Shiro: They are inseparable to the point that they freak out when they are placed in different rooms. And I mean that literally. So it's only fitting that I deal with them together. \n\nSora's main purpose in life, other than winning games, is extending his harem and witnessing as much fanservice as humanly possible. Kind of like the show itself. Judging by his portrayal, we are supposed to be proud too. Shiro is a supergenius, as evidenced by the totally legit random equations she writes sometimes. Oh, and she is in love with her brother to satisfy the obligatory \"incest subplot\" quota.\n\nBy the way, do you know why they were shut-ins? Because they were literally afraid of stepping through their front door. You see, Sora and Shiro are fine with any form of social interaction if they are in a game. In fact, they are genius negotiators. However, they become helpless the moment they step into the real world. But somehow they are fine in this game-filled fantasy world, even though the world itself is not a game. Basically:\n\nCrowded streets of a fantasy world -> They're fine\n\nEmpty streets of the real world -> They fall into a catatonic state\n\nPlausible human psychology, right? And it really is the streets, not the people. They try both of the mentioned combinations in the show. Sometimes it tries to assert they are really afraid of people, but this is very rare and inconsistent anyway, so it's literally the streets that are the problem. \n\nStephanie: Fanservice, and also standing there to be laughed at for her stupidity and to let Sora and Shiro provide exposition.\n\nJibril: More fanservice.\n\nTet: Barely appears. Has tons of free time, which he refuses to use to help the residents of his world because games are that much cooler than having a functional society. Why is he portrayed as benevolent again?\n\nOther characters: Who cares? They only exist for fanservice or to lose to the protagonists, or are practically irrelevant. \n\nA few words about the technical aspects:\n\nArt: 6\n\nDepends on how much you like fanservice and psychedelic neon colors.\n\nSound: 6\n\nPretty standard. Nothing really stood out that much as far as the soundtrack and voices were concerned.\n\nEnjoyment: 4\n\nThere is some enjoyment found in pointing out all the flaws in their tactics and the broader setting. Kind of like this review. You might think this show could be so bad it's good, but it's only barely. The show is too confident in its dysfunctional tactics, and many aspects of the show feel like a calculated ratings grab.\n\nOverall: 3\n\nThis show is a thoroughly artificial experience, a seemingly cynical attempt to cash in on the consumer. Their approach was simple enough: shove in as much wish fulfillment, references and fanservice as humanly possible and wait for the money to flow in.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheDeedsOfMen (\n34\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 27, 2014\n\nKapodaco\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n It's not uncommon for one to wish themselves out of a certain situation. Whether it be from an instinctual desire for a grander lifestyle or the pursuit of happiness, one's desires vary from person to person. This may also be what appeals to many who are fans of roleplaying or out of body experiences. The desire for what one cannot have has driven many to madness, and this topic has been used by many forms of entertainment over the years. What No Game No Life does with this topic is shows what can be accomplished when the main character takes what he has learned and\n\n...\n\napplies it to a world devoid of impossibilities. And when it comes to a world of impossibilities, there's no one better qualified to conquer it than those who follow their head instead of their heart. Actually, it probably wouldn't matter either way.\n\nTo accurately pinpoint exactly what No Game No Life is, one could describe it as two siblings trying to overthrow the god of a fantasy world after beating him in a game of chess. But overthrowing a god is no easy task. Firstly, they must overthrow the entire world. Whether taking over the fantasy world will even accomplish their goal is based on a presumption the main character conceived. But he's never been wrong once since entering the fantasy world, so it'd be better to go along with it. The presumptions of anything logically possible play into this world of impossibilities. No Game No Life makes it clear early on that anything worth thinking about doesn't belong in the games played in the fantasy world. Games can be won through ridiculous means. The games that are played are all conveniently geared towards the main characters' strengths. With each and every game, the characters inch closer and closer to their goal of overtaking a god. Despite everything, No Game No Life's progression is very straightforward. It doesn't try to take itself beyond the stars and it doesn't try to meddle in any unnecessary sub-plots. Most attention is dedicated to one singular mission, as stated above.\n\nAs one of the rules of the fantasy world, the denizens of said world must have fun and play games together. At its core, No Game No Life is just fun and games. When the characters aren't plotting for world domination, they're making jokes and pop culture references. The attempts at comedy during the course of the series are mostly reliant on exaggerated reactions and gratuitous fan service. While they can produce a snicker at times, it mostly feels like a cheap trick more than anything. The fan service usually comes at the expense of the female members of the cast, as a majority of the cast is, indeed, female. Whether it be from the results of a game or a part of the games themselves, it's safe to say that clothing will be removed in some fashion or another. The balance between silly and serious tends to lean more towards silly more often than not. This doesn't harm the validity of the plot much, as the plot is hard to take seriously regardless.\n\nIt doesn't take a veteran to be able to recognize the faults within the characters. With almost each and every character, there's something off about either their presentation or personality, something that goes deeper than how it appears. With a character such as Sora, the main character and only male among the main cast, you get a lanky, angsty kid who's supposedly too smart to appreciate his own world, so he does whatever he can to entertain himself. Once in the fantasy world, he quickly applies the rules to his situation and takes full advantage of them with one fell swoop. With every challenge, he dominates the opponent with the arrogance of a true king. By being nothing special socially, he acquires the admiration of all of his suitors without even trying, yet was unpopular in the real world. This implies that he could be the world's greatest human being, he just didn't care to put in the effort in his original life. Every quality of his character screams of a self-insert and moans of wish fulfillment. They combat this by giving him faults, like being a pervert or being unable to handle the outside world. But by doing this, they're making him all the more perfect. No one is perfect, so let's make him pseudo-perfect. It's perfectly despicable.\n\nOther members of the major cast aren't as loathsome as Sora, but still fall under the category of cliche or fan service, especially Sora's sister, Shiro. She's small, cute, quiet, and has an abnormal hair color. She also has an insatiable appetite for her brother's affection. All of these traits were manufactured especially for moe. And the icing on the cake is that she's adopted, so her desire for her brother's affection is excused, but still unwelcome. Shiro is essentially walking fan service. Stephanie Dola, the klutz, is one of two major characters born in the fantasy world. She is constantly teased for lacking the intelligence that all other characters share, despite being fairly intelligent in other matters. She is the source of most of the comedy and the fan service in the show, which makes her role within the show feel more shallow. As a character, she contributes little and goes nowhere in terms of growth, making her little more than a stock character. The last of the major characters is Jibril, a fairy-like creature who's thirst for knowledge is as creepy as Sora's expressions. She's more useful than Stephanie, and has a more likable personality, too. Of all the characters, she feels the most human, despite not being human. And as a member of the female race, she's subject to more fan service than one could ask for. Whether this matters is strictly based on the individual viewer's taste.\n\nThe first thing that was apparent with No Game No Life was its style of presentation. The artwork is reminiscent of Kamisami no Anai Nichiyoubi, whose creamy atmosphere created an effect of dreary depression and bubbly optimism. No Game No Life's art style is similar to a degree, as the brightness is on par with the sun's rays. The palette of color seemed to favor those with a calming, yet alluring power. Purple, maroon, light blue, and dark red are the colors that stand out most while watching this title, and their combination makes for a stunning outcome. Unfortunately, this type of presentation can be a little overbearing at times, as the lighting can sometimes make the characters blend in with the background or appear a tad too bright. The animation itself is one to be praised. It's charming, efficient, and bold; three things that can make an average anime look fantastic.\n\nIf anything, No Game No Life is interesting. The plot isn't anything as spectacular as it presents it and the characters are atrociously written, but it at least looks like a modern epic. The characters may be flat, but their interactions are humorous at times, granted they aren't playing games. Regardless of all of the flaws, it's entertaining to the highest degree, granted those who view it aren't too cynical. It has the qualities to succeed, it just uses them through means of popularity rather than quality. If anything, if one doesn't care to continue viewing No Game No Life, they can imagine themselves in a world outside of their grasp, similar to those within the series.

Perhaps this is more if a metaphorical statement but it is how No Game No Life (NGNL) is constructed as such. Well, not initially but in the mysterious world of Disboard, everything is determined by game – including your life. But first, we need to trace back a bit. This is because NGNL is based off a light novel of the same name focusing on two main characters and siblings as they conquer through Disboard and become Gods of their world. It’s a game like they have never played before.\n\nWritten by\n\n...\n\nJapanese-Brazilian author Yu Kamiya, the show adapts itself as a fantasy adventure. But unlike a show that takes place in some open world environment, NGNL takes place in a virtual realm full of wonders. And from this world, we meet hikikomori siblings Sora and Shiro. The two are known for their abilities in the gaming world as part a legendary group known as “Blank” (『　　』). Initially, they are considered unbeatable, so much that they are bored with their existence. Fate ties them one day after beating against a mysterious chess player earns them a trip to the Disboard world. \n\nA journey into NGNL will feel a bit anomalous. Think of it as trying to beat a video game but that you are not the one playing but rather as the actual player. For Sora and Shiro, this should initially be a walk in the park for their skills. But all is not as simple with the mechanics and rules in the Diaboard world. There are many concepts such as the “Exceed” categorized by 16 different races. The Imanity, the most humanoid of all the races, become a source of prejudice for their weaknesses. As such, the show portrays them as underdogs. However, we have Sora and Shiro to bring back honor and glory to their race. Thus, the show crafts itself as a way of progressing and experimental journey. We witness the siblings’ ascension and rise to the top. Their ultimate goal is to beat Tet, the creator of the world in order to become the One True God. From a perspective point, it’s easy to tell what the show is trying to do with such a premise. There are vast potential development for the characters, world building, and dynamics of its rules. While it seems like one big challenge to tackle for gamers, the show portrays it more than that. Because for those rules, there’s a certain degree of ways to bypass such restrictions. The show depicts itself as more of an experimental product with Sora and Shiro being the professors. Only of course, they also come into this world as gamers, fight with a gaming image, and bring pride to what they fight for. It’s a journey beyond just saving some princess from a castle or win some fame.\n\nIt’s hard to judge the first episode since the show slowly draws itself out with its concepts and characters. But for starters, the main sibling duo of Sora and Shiro is not your usual or typical pair of brother and sister. They are gamers, and while not professional demonstrates a status of unparalleled levels. But what really makes them stand out is the way that they complement each other with their abilities making them nearly omniscient. And unlike most siblings, they have a very dynamic relationship. Neither of them treats each other as superior or inferior but instead on equal standing. Throughout the series, it’s clearly shown that they care deeply for one another. One instance shows Shiro’s deep concern when she finds out that Sora was not with her anymore. Similarly, whenever they are apart, they display the traditional or perhaps stereotypical attributes of a NEET. The focus on the sibling twins is not their development but rather their characters. It’s straight-forward but at the same time unconventional. The gap age difference between the duo might suggest that their skills differ. Yet, they show explicitly their skills individually and collectively to be able to carry the torch to victory. \n\nThroughout their journey to become Gods, the siblings encounter a variety of characters that joins them in their crusade. Joining them includes humans such as Stephanie Dola, also simply known as “Steph”. The show depicts her as a scapegoat after losing to the twins. Her role becomes more like a servant as the siblings adds her on their list of conquered objectives, literally. Then, there’s a more playful Jibril that also becomes somewhat of a scapegoat. But unlike Steph, she’s portrayed as an energetic oddball. NGNL portrays all four of these characters like they are crusaders to fight through the Disboard world. Furthermore, the show often likes to make fun of its own characters by their image and characteristics. For instance, Steph becomes a meme in the show for her master/dog relationship with the siblings. After being a subject to an unexpected order, Steph can be viewed not such as a scapegoat but as a play toy. And really, that’s what their journey becomes like – a game where they play their way to victory whether it’d be utilizing their minds or through cheating; anything to win because that’s what it matters. \n\nDespite the serious nature of the siblings’ goal to conquer God, the show often makes fun of itself with its characters, concepts, and even references/gags to deliver entertainment. Throughout the show, characters break through the boundaries of logic whether it’d be in chess, rock-paper-scissors, physics, or just gaming itself to unimaginative levels. They create the idea that ‘games with rules are meant to be broken’. And from my perspective, it’s fun and a blast to get out of. After all, it’s not usually fun to watch someone else play a game than playing it yourself. Yet, this show can deliver a way where you almost feel like you are part of their quest to conquer the world. Furthermore are the concepts and dialogues. Even the various references from other popular cultures can spawn some laughter if noticed. Then, there’s also iconic speeches, misleading dialogues, and gags all ties in to craft NGNL’s unconventional image. Through this execution, the show explicitly presents game formulas beyond just playing for fun. This should have been obvious anyways since the show likes to take daring risks. And although these risks can be appealing, it can also be controversial. The way some characters behave are borderline inappropriate, die-hard, and become a wish- fulfillment fantasy. Through its style, the show also desperately saturates characters and scenes with fan service. Some can feel a bit uncomfortable especially for characters such as Shiro or implied animal innuendos in the case of Steph. It feels irrational and unoriginal with circle of clichés most explicitly fueled by the dialogues with its characters and incest undertones. Even the plot/premise itself has some tastes of unoriginality when compared to recent shows such as Problem Children, Accel World, or Log Horizon. Only for NGNL, it’s more about just beating the game through unpredictable outcomes. Some other quirks about the show might involve its romance as at least two characters show interest in Shiro. But most times, the show borders on a harem-esque route as he makes impressions on the ladies. In retrospect, don’t expect any genuine romance development but rather teases without nothing more than a simple foreplay.\n\nMadhouse does it again once again with its successful cultural and visual display. The world of Diaboard is illustrated with layers on top of layers of fantasy that destroys any sense of realism but creates that credible mood of being stuck in a virtual realm. The colorful palates are designed with abnormal touches of fantasy at every turn whether it’d be the games, the various landscapes, towns, and characters. Speaking of which, the characters also has credibility with physical appearances to portray them as heirs, gamers, and angels. On the other hand, fan service is explicit and never attempts to hide itself in any way or form with its distracting scenarios. At the same time, it also defiles logic with characters such as Shiro with white hair despite being 11 years old. Yet, every species has a distinctive look to create diversity as well. Hell, we even get to see Shiro wear a crown to show that she is a queen and Sora displaying his philanthropic traits by wearing a shirt with the iconic:\n\nI ♥ Humans\n\nTechnical prowess also come with its soundtrack. Distinctively directed, each episode makes cleaver usage of its OST for tactical, emotional, and climatic scenes. Character voices are also dynamic with a figurative speech tone. The way characters speak doesn’t feel dull or like a monologue but rather filled with energy. In fact, the soundtrack has doses of hyperactivity when it comes to its presenting gameplay machinations. To meet the end of its style, the OP and ED song are also decorated with attractiveness and catchy tone. One particular episode even makes fun of itself (for plotline purposes) through distorted crediting. It’s needless to say but headphones are a must to get the satisfaction that you deserve.\n\nAs a show that deconstructs game tropes, NGNL also serves as an experimental way to deliver a fantasy adventure. The show often pokes fun at itself whether it’d be cultures, rules, or just in general anything it can get its hands on. While the show doesn’t escape its labyrinth of clichés, it also finds way to parody them through clever usage of humorous executions. It’s more than just mindless entertainment as NGNL delivers with energy and exclusive empowerment to appeal audiences by its concepts. The way to enjoy NGNL isn’t to follow the story like it’s some sort of instructional manual but rather as what it intended to be – gaming level of entertainment. Otherwise, you’ll be biting your gums of logic so much, it'll bleed.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Stark700 (\n722\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 26, 2014\n\nDemi_V\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n NEETs are usually referred to as people who take a long break from society to do whatever they please, causing others to view them as “lazy” or envy them for having freedom. But if NEETs were born with superhuman intelligence and prove to be more noteworthy than your average student or professional, they deserve a lot more respect. \n\nMeet No Game No Life, Madhouse’s new light and playful production, featuring NEETs with an objective to become God of a new world. It’s understandable that NGNL is a fantasy where you can use your wildest imagination and can’t possibly go wrong, but a common mistake that\n\n...\n\nfantasy anime like NGNL fail to do is abide by its principles. A fantasy still needs some sense of logic for slamming two geniuses who are capable of doing anything into its story. NGNL presents itself as a brilliant, captivating series but progresses to show little-by-little how it moves away from intelligence, proving how the protagonists are not as invincible as portrayed to be.\n\nBlank, a brother-sister duo named Sora and Shiro, is quite peculiar. All of their wins are accomplished by teamwork, and one brain cannot function well without the other nearby. They make their debut as a couple who’s unbeatable and leaks intimidation. NGNL presents these protagonists with unexplained abilities, which makes their brilliance invalid. You learn nothing about Blank besides the fact they’re undefeatable and possess genius-level intelligence. They both suffer from a social disorder that causes them to freak out when separated and gives Sora enough reason to sit outside the girls’ bath to stay within a certain distance of Shiro. Besides a vague backstory of their first encounter, NGNL reveals nothing about their parents, their lives in Tokyo, or any kind of self-narration to back up their intelligence or social disorder. This results in NGNL’s inability to follow through on its brilliance. Despite being undefeatable, Blank faces dead ends, admits defeat, and gets miraculously saved at the last minute. Even if there were changes in games or situations entirely, you’d expect clever approaches from super intelligent protagonists besides raising the white flag. Like always, NGNL disguises such inconveniences with gag comedy references to please jaded views.\n\nOne of the aspects noteworthy in NGNL are the games ranging from as simple as rock-paper-scissors to majorly complex and fun like a simulation game. Blank’s immediate drawbacks and impressive comebacks make it more watchable. The explanations of game plans were interesting. This makes Stephanie Dola a great add to the series, because someone has to play the simple-minded character to dumb down the complex moves and game rules for everyone else to understand. The games have their flaws though. Blank arrives into a world decided by games, ran by 10 pledges, and ruled by a little boy who only became God by default because of incompetent adults. The 10 pledges are a nice gesture to keep world order, but it is just another excuse to make Blank seem intimidating. There’s a pledge that denounces cheating, giving gamers an automatic loss if caught. Most of the games consisted of someone cheating or trying to overcome a cheat. Still, this brings two conclusions. Either Blank is indeed genius, or everyone in the new world is incredibly stupid and uses cheats to hide the fact they lack wisdom and the appropriate skills to win. Blank faces every opponent with a confident attitude, expecting a 100% win. Then the show becomes predictable, because Blank is always right. None of their opponents are challenging enough to take them on. The pacing was just right, so 12 episodes was not enough to fulfill the primary objective and ends with a cliffhanger.\n\nThe majority of the cast is female, giving Sora several chances to play the dominate male and open pervert. This makes characters appear as airheads or suffer high risks for Blank's purposes. The characters vary in personalities and abilities, and NGNL did a great job dividing their abilities based upon their race. Some had their own fetishes as well. Each of them played a role in Blank’s overall objective, so each one has his or her own unique trait whether it’s attractive or vice versa. Since this is a comedy, characters freely act outrageous after a serious moment in an attempt to get a laugh. It is only regarded to a certain extent, because they do not always act appropriately to certain situations, making it hard to distinguish the comedy and seriousness. Their sudden reactions to surprises are mostly hilarious, especially Blank’s reaction when Stephanie says something bright for a change. Some of the characters share backstories and relationships that can possibly give viewers a different impression of them.\n\nNGNL takes ecchi over the top with its fanservice. Awkward cliché scenes of falling and landing into boobs make it annoying and close to a harem. Most games consist of girls losing clothes or undergarments sometimes as an excuse for virgin Sora to get his feels. However, I disregard this a little considering that NGNL is clearly within the ecchi genre, so this is expected. I mainly mentioned it as a warning to those who despises the abuse of ecchi fanservice. The only flaw is how this makes every game predictable, because each one seems to need fanservice for strategic purposes or solutions. \n\nThe pastel colors are initially what makes NGNL so lively, and I applaud Madhouse for taking a different approach with unique artwork and animation. As someone who is not a big fan of ecchi, I found it to be tolerable because of the pastel colors. The settings and character design were unbelievably gorgeous, and it is greatly necessary to distinguish the vast races and their territories within the world, including the elves and warbeasts. Except NGNL seems to care more about their appeal than abiding by the law of gravity. Clearly, you cannot hold onto a floating cloth in the sky as if it’s an airplane wing or Aladdin's magic carpet. Characters hang upside down and their hair doesn't follow their lead. Even if gravitational failure is not a big deal, it makes NGNL misleading considering that an arc touched on the concepts of science a great deal, including gravity.\n\nThe background music was suitable for the game theme of NGNL, but there are music references from other games to make the OST seem unoriginal. Sometimes it was confusing. NGNL seemed to have a hard time differentiating between comedy and seriousness, and the music gives it away. Something unexpected happens, characters make a big deal out of it, and yet the music is just as cheerful as ever. The OP and ED were very good, and the lyrics fit the show’s theme and Blank’s relationship quite well. There are no complaints about the seiyuu either, because they all switched their tones appropriately during certain situations, especially Blank. They succeeded with the sound effects, too, and it brought out the comedy more.\n\nNGNL was a fun show to watch, and I looked forward to seeing a new episode every week. Impressive strategic gameplay, clever comebacks from Blank, and the beautiful animation with pastel colors are a few things that intrigued me. Despite how much I loved it, NGNL doubtlessly lacked the maturity and logic it needed to achieve the pursuit for powerful, undefeatable characters. The fantasy genre can be imaginative, as long as the show supports their ideas with some kind of explanation like NGNL failed to do. If you want to introduce super intelligent NEETs with an objective to take over the world, perfect. But to make them into something overly invincible with unexplained abilities without any backstory or presentation of evidence? That’s a tough cookie to break. Since NGNL won as the hype of Spring 2014, there’s no doubt in my mind that there’s a sequel awaiting us in the future.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Demi_V (\n42\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 25, 2014\n\nNachteule\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Everywhere I go here on MAL I see people praising this show. 10s are almost the standard since this show aired. Almost impossible to escape to the hype surrounding this anime I found myself watching the first episode even though I am against fan-fiction like stories such as this one. So, what do I think of the show?\n\nWell, it has been quite a bumpy road with No Game No Life for me. A surprisingly weak start with almost every cliché in just two or three episodes a pandering show like this could ever contain and more headshakes I ever did when watching anime since Sword\n\n...\n\nArt Online were part of this experience. It got gradually more bearable though as the series reached its end to say the least.\n\nWell, let's take a look in what the alleged \"Anime of the Season\" has to offer.\n\nWhen reading the synopsis I was already shaking my head in disbelief. Yet another fan-fiction premise, yet again super cool NEETs living the life 90% of the people here would gladly kill for? I am certain it is unnecessary to tell what No Game No Life is all about since most of you guys reading this are already watching it as well.\n\nLet's rather talk about the problems I had with the story. \n\nAlso note, so far no second season has announced. I will treat the story section of No Game No Life as if no second season is announced when coming to the ending. Yes, I know there is a light novel of the show but we are reviewing the anime here. Not the light novel!\n\nFirst of all, No Game No Life tried to achieve so much in just a twelve episode run-time it felt rushed at times just to squeeze in as much as possible. They want to take over the whole world but how much could they possibly get my just twelve episodes? \n\nI guess it may be just me but the whole set up and how it was handled is way too convenient for me to overlook it. Yes, \"Blank\" consisting of Sora and his super-intelligent-NEET-hikikomori-loli imouto providing regular panty shots Shiro are unbeatable, literally unbeatable. The story part of No Game No Life felt like watching a newcomer play Dark Souls for the first time with god mode enabled because just as Blank (I guess I figured out why the name's \"Blank\". Which makes it easier for self-insertion!), he'd be undefeatable no matter how big the challenge may look or what there is at stake. There is no sense of tension because you can predict that Blank will win no matter what. All you do is wait for the resolution on how they did it which is unpredictable because the main characters are alleged geniuses which - for me - was nowhere near this fascinating. Not saying this is all bad, it really is entertaining and gets you by surprise being exposed to their kind of play for the first few times, but most of the explanations just felt like Deus Ex Machina which again could be excused by them being geniuses.\n\nIn terms of world building No Game No Life did an average at best job as well. Yes, humanity is now called \"Imanity\" and is on the bottom of the food chain amongst other beings inhabiting this world. But yet again this is hardly explained in detail to make me personally attached at all. Also the other species are as original as it gets with your average elf-like beings using their magic, the war beasts having super-human speed and agility, there is no originality to be found here either. \n\nThe games they play are also not seemingly flawless and even contain plot holes in how they were executed by the show, for example the game of Shiratori in episode 6 where every player had 30 seconds to make their next move. Because Blank is so perfect though it just takes them almost a whole minute just for one. How things like those get past a quality check seems incomprehensible to me.\n\nThe general pacing was also one of the things which bugged me. Most of the time there just wasn't anything meaningful going on and time got wasted for nonsensical reference humor or blatant fan service which is a thing I highly dislike in anime.\n\nRegarding the visuals No Game No Life scored way better at me. I like it when studios try out new stuff and come out as daring especially at something crucial as the visuals. No Game No Life kept an overall decent standard of quality and used an interesting if even maybe unusual and surreal art style as well as fluid animation. To be honest watching the first few episodes it seemed way too surreal and almost unpleasing for me personally. As the time went by though I found myself getting attached to it as it fitted the show’s theme quite well. As said, credit where credit is due, the makers dared to stand out from the norm and delivered a more than solid job in my eyes even if I ended up hating how they made Shiro and her facial expressions with her tiny mouth. This surely is just me but I couldn't stand some of the character designs at all.\n\nComing to the acoustic performance of No Game No Life I just have positive things to say. Starting with a strong and catchy opening theme the series never failed to convey a certain feeling of tension during moments when Blank once again had triumphed over their mentally inferior enemies. The soundtrack is literally what kept me hoping for more to come, being composed very well and used even better in the right scenes. If I had one thing to complain about the soundtrack it would be that some of songs got used to often and lacked in overall variety. Considering their quality this is a thing I am willing to forgive.\n\nThe voice acting was also top-notch and leaves barely room to complain, except the characters which they voice acted.\n\nThe characters are actually my biggest complaint alongside the not really original and sometimes even rigged by plot holes part that is the story. Blank may be perfect but this is just the thing which won't sell me for No Game No Life. They are too perfect, every of their moves in unpredictable it almost comes off as a downright ass pull - speaking only of the main characters Sora and Shiro though. The rest of the cast is entirely female and besides one tear-jerking moment of Stephanie it gets completely downgraded to pure fan service which is a shame because since later on they threw some other races into the bunch as well which could have been used for great character and world building but was cut to the most essential things and once again fan service because since the \"Flugel\" is a flying race they have their erogenous zones on their wings. Ha-ha, so clever. Not. And of course every female which gets to meet a smelly and skinny NEET is most likely to want to explore his erogenous zones. Totally what would happen in real life! And besides the main cast there were barely important characters which could be used even if only as plot devices.\n\nDespite the problems I had with the show, I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy No Game No Life the slightest bit. The atmosphere was right during the moments it should have been to grab my attention even when just for a little moment longer than it managed before. The conclusions weren't always the most logical or the most likely ones but satisfying nevertheless if you take the show what it's supposed to be; an entertaining pseudo-intelligent comedy. Regarding the comedy No Game No Life consists of solely two parts of comedic \"attempts\". One would be referential humor and the other being fan service. What I personally missed where clever jokes and not just some sexual slurs or innuendos alongside some deadbeat jokes. The most entertaining parts for me where not the ones others would consider to be funny but for how Blank would manage to achieve the next goal. Not if they would but how - because Blank can't lose.\n\nSumming this up No Game No Life was a decent entry of the wish-fulfillment-genre which must include beautiful women, a super cool and flawless main character, games, video-games, a world to escape to. It stood out using a rather unique art style and underlining it with a very good soundtrack but lacked in story and characterization. Too much time was wasted on fan service which could have been used on actual development of the over sexualized almost all-female cast. While I didn't expect much after reading the synopsis I wouldn't even say I got disappointed but the hype surrounding it seems similar to the one Sword Art Online experienced back in the day. Unlike Sword Art Online No Game No Life is self-aware most of the time and at least does not take itself seriously to a level where it comes off as forced drama. It knows what it wants to be and pulls that off quite nicely and confident, ending up being entertaining but nothing of outstanding quality.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Nachteule (\n11\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 8, 2014\n\nRivayne\n\nNot Recommended\n\n No Game No Life, the anime everyone was talking about this season. Everywhere on MAL and the anime subreddit everyone was praising NGNL. I tried hard to like it but I just couldn't, there was almost nothing redeemable about this show. If the show is bad then why do people watch it? And how did it get so popular? Well I guess I'll try my best to describe, while not spoiling as much as I can. \n\nFirst off I'll start by listing all of the positives about this show, the art and animation was beautiful, nothing less to be expected by MadHouse. The OST was\n\n...\n\ngreat music at the wrong times, so I'm not sure if I could count that as a positive, but the OST in general is above average. And a colorful and beautiful World with endless opportunities for creativity. \n\nSo the plot is about two NEETs who are brother and sister, win at any game with 0% chance of losing. Why did the author end up making the protagonists NEETS? Well because he wanted to make most of the community who watch anime feel good about themselves. You could pretty much describe every character in one word and know everything about them, for example Sora is a beautiful virgin NEET who is somehow a genius who wins any game possible that's set in front of him. Shiro, who is Sora's sister, does literally next to nothing in the show except act as fanservice for lolicons. \n\nThe side characters are sadly even more one dimensional if that is even possible. So why does Sora have 3000 favorites then? Well just like Lelouche from Code Geass, or Light from Death Note, Sora is incredibly over powered and every other character in the series is retarded compared to him, we could say he is the big fish in the extremely small pool. Actually we could say he is the big fish in the small fish tank all by himself since all the other characters are non existent compared to him. \n\nEarlier I mentioned Sora was over powered and that he wins any game 100% of the time, in the series he even says he wins games before they are even played. So in this new magical land that they are brought to, there is no wars, any dispute is solved over games. Games decide everything, even who owns which land. So the games could have been really interesting but you could tell from the beginning, no matter what Sora would win any game so there wasn't much to care about. Although I will admit some of the games mechanics were pretty interesting and MadHouse did an amazing job animating them. \n\nWhenever Sora won a game, the episode would end and we would get 2 or 3 episodes of SoL + fan service shoved down our throats. As someone who loves SoL, a genre that relies 100% on how good their characters are. Well the characters in NGNL are honestly the worst cast I have seen yet, The SoL elements were so horrible that they had to rely on ecchi and fanservice. Hell actually half of the side characters in Sora's harem were only made for fan service, for example an angel who acted as nothing but a slave. She turned a complete 180 from being an angel who had no respect for humans to a slave who is completely loyal in a matter of minutes. \n\nNear the last couple of episodes you could tell that they were running out of ideas and it just started to feel stale. Also the ending was very dissatisfying and didn't come near to bringing the season to a close. I enjoyed watching the show a bit, but that was mostly because MadHouse did such a good job with the art and animation.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Rivayne (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nNov 6, 2014\n\nKimuraaaa\n\nRecommended\n\n No Game No Life is yet another anime about games, but this one is different, and in a lot of good ways, the world created is a charming yet surprisingly deep land of politics and interesting characters all around.\n\nInstead of writing an essay about this i'm going to create a list of Positives and Negatives, I know when you're just looking to see if an anime is worth watching you usually don't want to read all that much.\n\nPositives\n\n- The story always seems to be moving forwards and never seems to slow down always introducing new and interesting characters to meet.\n\n- The art style is beautiful,\n\n...\n\nthe world in general is extremely bright and colourful and everything is outline with more of a red tone than most anime's, this helps to differentiate its style from the crowd and really makes it a pleasure to view.\n\n- The characters are all interesting and I always found myself wanting to learn more about them and their origins.\n\n- The relationship between Sora and Shiro is great.\n\nNegatives\n\n- The relationship between Sora and Shiro might turn off some viewers.\n\n- The 'Blank Never Loses' dynamic is interesting in some areas but it does get rid of some of the tension from certain battles.\n\n- The series ends on an extreme cliffhanger\n\n- Sound was nothing special.\n\nI would recommend No Game Life to most people if only because it is extremely short at this stage, it won't take you long to power through the 12 episodes, however if you don't like cliffhangers you should definitely hold off on watching No Game No Life.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Kimuraaaa (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 25, 2014\n\nToastytheBaker\n\nRecommended\n\n Blank can unite this burning land and bring an end to all this Disboard!! (haha puns, Disboard, discord.)\n\n-Overall\n\nNo Game No Life is about 2 NEETs, Sora and Shiro, who are geniuses when it comes to games. They are transported to a world where games decide everything from national borders to theft. Because Sora and Shiro are amazing at games, this world, called Disboard, (haha discord, this board, disboard, hahahaha games haha) seems like their dream world. The art reflects this, with it's unique coloration and artstyle.\n\nThe voices are very well done, and the soundtrack is very fitting. The characters each have comedic elements associated with\n\n...\n\nthem, so depending on the current interactions of characters, different jokes and comedy scenes can be made. This helps freshen up the comedy and keep it new. This show was my favorite this season, and the comedy and bad*ssery that Sora and Shiro did make me hope for a season 2. Personally, I think a season 2 is likely because the anime is receiving so much praise and recognition, and the light novel that the anime is based off of is progressing quickly. \n\nStory: 8.25\n\nArt: 9.95\n\nSound: 9\n\nCharacter: 9.15\n\nEnjoyment: 10\n\nOverall: 9.27. It's great. \n\nMore details down below.\n\n-Story:\n\nThe story of No Game No Life is well built. First off, the premise is well explained. There is a world where 10 pledges govern sentient beings, and games decide everything. Why this is is explained early on and the pledges are constantly stated to make sure the audience understands the setting. The story is entertaining and progresses quite naturally. Sora and Shiro must take small steps before they take the large ones, and that is reflected in the 12 episodes.\n\n-Art\n\nThe art for No Game No Life is amazing. It's unique art style helps create a dreamy atmosphere, reflecting on the fact that Disboard really is Sora and Shiro's dream world. It always looks fantastic.\n\n-Sound\n\nThe voices are very well done, and sound very genuine. The music is very good as well, and goes well with the scenes.\n\n-Character\n\nThe characters are lovable. Sora and Shiro are geniuses, and everyone likes geniuses. But they aren't incredibly intellectual, which most of us aren't, making them relatable. Sora is smart, but aside from when he's \"being smart,\" he acts like a (for the most part) like a normal person. Same with Shiro. All the characters provide a comedic aspect unique to that character in the series, and depending on which characters currently have the spotlight, different jokes are made, spicing up the comedy quite a bit.\n\n-Enjoyment\n\nThis is probably my favorite anime this season, and I always looked forward to watching this show. I'm sad too see it go, but excited for next season.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ToastytheBaker (\n18\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 30, 2014\n\nar2000\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n A lot of popular shows have plenty of problems that are often ignored because they pander to their intended audience and NGNL (No Game, No Life) is no exception. The impressions one would likely get from the hype surrounding NGNL are it’s “an amazing show with an original premise and spectacular story-telling.” Though this is mostly exaggeration, as this show is far from amazing, it’s also far from awful for plenty of good reasons. NGNL’s glory stems from how well it knows its audience and that is a point in its favor, but there are definitely issues with it that should be addressed.\n\nIt’s easy to\n\n...\n\nargue that a show with good characters is a good show and NGNL has this aspect covered, whether the former is true or not. A very serious person might laugh at that statement, but that laughter is coming from the ignorance of the characters’ purpose. Each of the characters do their apparent job well and that is to be distinct and interesting as well as appeal to the target audience. The excellence of the cast is thanks to the way the NGNL allows it’s intended audience to relate to it’s main characters and that is a sign of competence from the creators (or that they are lucky).\n\nHowever, though the characters are a high point of NGNL for being interesting, and in a way fun, it’s hard to deny their flaws. For one, our two main characters, the siblings Sora and Shiro, are nearly perfect (ironically, considering I’m saying this is a flaw), and it sucks a lot of the anxiety you might have, and even some of the fun, out of the show. They do seem to be self-aware, but it hardly excuses this problem. In fact, their aptitude in nearly everything is ridiculous considering their circumstances. It’s clear that this probably only to give them “cool points” and cheat its main audience into thinking the characters are well designed (I use cheat loosely). All this is only compounded by how the other prominent members of NGNL’s cast of characters, such as Steph and Jibril, only help boost Sora and Shiro’s ego as they seem to only compliment their incredible skill, both indirectly and directly. Also, it’s unbecoming for the cast that most of the characters are there solely for “fanservice” and other appeal. As such, even though this anime’s characters are “fun and cool”, they aren’t nearly realistic and have exaggerated abilities (and personalities too).\n\nWith all that said about the overall above average cast, it’s unfortunate the premise isn’t as original as plenty claim because similar stories have definitely been conceived and written. That isn’t foretelling of an uninspired plot though, is it? The answer to that question is subjective, but it doesn’t matter that much. The story almost entirely focuses on the siblings, brother and sister, Sora and Shiro as they are brought to an alternate world after beating the god of said world in a game. In this world, everything is decided by games (not violence, debate, etc.) so you’d think this would allow for some creativity involving all the games they will likely be playing. Unfortunately, whoever authored NGNL seemingly always uses a likeness to a Deus Ex Machina as the solution for the siblings inevitably winning the games they play. The way the games are played are less intelligent than they are presented. To be honest, for a show about games, the games aren’t exciting at all because you know the outcome is always that the siblings will win. Also, the story itself isn’t very interesting anyway, as the things that mostly happen are playing games and cracking jokes so NGNL heavily relies on “fanservice” and references which isn’t a strong foothold. It’s good the forced drama is rare though.\n\nThis might put NGNL down a bit, but beneath the unpolished story is a nice setting that is not fully explored. Because Sora and Shiro decide to try defeating and uniting the intelligent races in the new world they arrive in, we get to explore many of the interesting places that said world contains. NGNL doesn’t feed us with a lot of adventure and exploration though, so this could be a missed opportunity.\n\nNot only is the setting very nicely designed, the animation compliments it too. The animation quality is not top-notch, but it is unique. It’s nice to see something different as the art uses some uncommon colors and has a nice hue of orange.\n\nOther than that, the voice acting is good as the voice actors do their jobs well. There aren’t any performances of immediate note though. Also, the music is fine, but there is better out there\n\nOverall, even though NGNL will likely leave a positive impression on you, its also good to consider its undeniable flaws. It’s something you’ll definitely like if you land in its target audience range. That means you like random fanservice and the predictable outcome of the games. If you don’t like it, you’ll probably find this anime poor for trying to act smart and tripping like a fool. While NGNL may have an uninteresting premise, its characters and setting make up for a good portion of it. And though it’s not as good as some may claim it to be, it’s an exaggeration to say it’s bad. NGNL is a fun experience, but it’s not all it’s praised to be and not a must watch. You may want to watch it for that orange hue though.\n\n5/10\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ar2000 (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 26, 2014\n\nathetosis\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n \"Contender for anime of the season\"\n\n\"No doubt the best series currently airing\"\n\n\"Anime of the year\"\n\n\"Best thing I've ever seen\"\n\n\"11/10, it was okay\" -ign\n\nThis is just a sample of the plethora of praise No Game No Life (NGNL) has garnered as of recent. Undoubtedly loved by many and raised up by fans to no end, calling NGNL hyped would be an understatement. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing, however, whether or not it can live up to the countless 10/10 reviews and its 8.87 rating making it the 16th highest rated anime on MAL is a whole different matter. \n\nEnjoyment-9/10\n\nI'm beginning with the enjoyment\n\n...\n\nof this show because this is without a doubt the most alluring aspect of the show and probably the main cause of the ceaseless acclaim this series continues to earn. And it is for good reason; this show essentially has something for everyone. There are few things that NGNL fails to incorporate into itself and the resulting audience it can pertain to encompass many. With video game and anime references alike, accompanied by what seems like an infinite amount of anime tropes and cliches, it definitely entertains the general audience. \n\nThe show is entertaining almost all the time and for the most part does not bore bar the irrelevant scene every now and then (I'm looking at you random bath scenes). Really if anything, the enjoyment you can get out of this show is absurd and makes the show what it is more than the characters, plot, or the art. However what makes the show a lot less enjoyable is the abundance of ecchi material within it. You are constantly bombarded with fan-service each and every episode and while some say it does not detract from the show, it certainly does even if a little bit. \n\nSo if you like being entertained and want to watch something you really enjoy, this is it. There are very few other anime that can entertain as well as NGNL and if you want to just sit back and relax, turn off your brain for a while, and just have a good time this is all you'll need. No need to read the rest of my review if that's all you want in an anime. \n\nStory-6/10\n\nIf you want to read a summary of the show, there is a synopsis section so go read that before all the reviewers put it out of a job. \n\nThat aside, the story is somewhat interesting. The world building and overall setting are absolutely well executed and come together very well to create a whole fantasy world that does not seem lacking but is rather quite well developed. The entire world that is presented with the many interactions and conflicts within it are extremely well done and although it is definitely unrealistic in a sense that it is fantasy after all, it is still extremely close to reality. \n\nOnto the actual plot itself, there are very few, if any, plot holes throughout the story and because of this viewers will be able to feel that although it is just a fictional world, it really could exist. The pacing is almost perfect. It rarely feels rushed (there was only one episode) and so every event is given enough time to occur and watchers thus given enough time to comprehend and follow the story. However the plot does slow down at time to create intermissions between major plot events which intentionally relieves the tension and keeps that light-hearted touch yet at the same time relieves a lot of the tension within the serious parts of NGNL causing the plot to be a lot less serious and weaker.\n\nYet the weakest part of the plot and what makes it so weak is easily its predictability. Although the many puzzles and games make it seem complex or intelligent, it is at the core really just a simple plot that makes it very easily appreciated and enjoyable. The ways in which each problem is solved are at the very least creative and definitely fun to experience but are in no ways complex or mind-blowing. So if the methods to their winning is definitely unpredictable to some extent then what is so predictable? The outcomes. UnfortunatelyIn the end, the aftermath of each conflict is easily anticipated. The plot is essentially just a repeat of finding enemies, challenging them, winning, and becoming friend and this is what makes NGNL so much weaker in this regard. The one thing they utilize very well though is cliffhangers. The sheer amount of cliffhangers is absurd and most episodes to end off with one leaving you craving for the next. \n\nAlthough many will claim that the story is a masterpiece, there is very little that is deeper within it. A good story contains underlying themes which the story then pushes to convey to the audience and incite change or at the very least discussion and conflicting ideas. Thankfully NGNL does contain an argument but unfortunately it is the execution of them which is off the mark. Whereas good writing would establish its themes early on and continually build upon the themes subtly through imagery and symbolism as the story progressed, NGNL ignores its themes and is void of them for the majority of itself only to suddenly remember that it had a message to present and then suddenly shoving the theme at you near the end in hopes that you would have caught on to them. \n\nDefinitely though, it really is difficult to take the plot seriously because of just how plain silly it is and that in itself is not a bad thing but with all the fans of the show raving on about how great and genius the story is, it will no doubt leave you disappointed.\n\nArt-9/10\n\nThe animation style used by Madhouse in NGNL is unique or at the very least uncommon. It has a bright and vibrant colour palette that is very nice to look at and because of how separated the colours are from reality, it compliments the fantasy world they live in and only makes it more beautiful. The gags pulled in the show and references made to other media is also very well expressed and their ability to switch from style to style makes each reference so much more fluid and recognizable. The colours are a little bit tiring on the eyes however as a result of all the bright colours (think a bunch of neon signs). \n\nSound-6/10\n\nThe voice acting is good; memorable voices that express the personalities and emotions that express the characters well. The music is lacking however and unfortunately is unmemorable (I literally cannot remember if there was any to begin with). It's definitely not bad enough so that it subtracts from the show, but neither is it good enough that it makes it any better. \n\nCharacter-4/10\n\nPeople seem to believe that the characters in this show are somehow amazing and unique yet how is that possible when each and every character in the show are built upon popular anime tropes. You have everything in this show from NEETs to tsunderes, to animal girls, demons/angels, and even elves. The characters are likable, that's for sure. After all, with such a wide variety of overdone characters, how could you not like one of them. But what makes the characters the weakest is not their lack of originality. Rather it is the lack of proper development for most of the characters. Perhaps this is a result of the show only being 12 episodes long, but any form of development within the main characters is completely absent. They can probably be described best as super computers with personalities. Although they have traits that take them outside of the regular character molds, any type of change in personality or even ability is absent throughout the series. They start as geniuses and end as geniuses and that's all they are. You learn little about their past and see no changes in their character whatsoever. \n\nThen you have the supporting characters. Fortunately these characters have development over the course of the show but it isn't enough. As each conflict begins with finding an enemy and then beating and befriending them, every supporting character that joins the main cast as the show progresses actually changes but as soon as they do, the plot moves onto the next order of business and their development is put aside for these new \"villains\" to appear. Hence the only characters with advancement in the entirety of the show are those few supporting characters present from the very beginning. Regrettably even those characters are set aside continuously and then made to serve as either eye-candy or comedic relief for episodes on end. \n\nOverall the characters are for the most part flat and two-dimensional. Who they are can be taken at face value because the characters of NGNL undoubtedly have only one layer to them. They never stray from what they establish themselves as when they are introduced, never showing any signs of actually being complex characters but rather show how simple and one-sided they all are. As beautiful as those one sides are and as entertaining as they can be they are in the end still one sided and become repetitive before long.\n\nOverall-6.5/10\n\nDoes NGNL live up to the hype? Definitely not. Certainly the enjoyment of the show there and it has a wide audience with simple plots and characters that aid in how easily people can appreciate it, but the enjoyment of the show seems to have caused a bias in which those weak characters and predictable plot are all but ignored in favour of its entertainment value. All in all it is a good show overall; definitely above your average fantasy show but not as much as people make it out to be. It is far from the masterpiece people like to think it is. I'll admit, the mood of the show and its overall fun feeling makes it very easy to forget about its flaws but in the end those flaws are still there and should not be overlooked. The plot is far from serious and is nowhere close to being as complex or stunning as people make it out to be and although the characters may be lovable and are all fun to watch, they are at the same time flat and unfinished, leading you to become bored of them at times. If you're looking to be entertained and have fun watching a show, this is it, but don't go in expecting anything deep or intelectual. \n\nTL;DR: BEST SHOW OF 2014!

There, they are caught up in humanity's struggle for survival, which is mostly based on politics and the relative strengths of the other races, since in the alternate world there is no war or killing. Since Sora and Shiro are already incredibly skilled at games due to\n\n...\n\ntheir talents in logical thinking and strategy, they have no trouble playing their way towards being the new rulers of Elkia, the human kingdom, and subsequently challenging the other races with the ultimate goal to defeat Tet, the god of the game world. \n\nI'll admit, with the hype surrounding NGNL along with the bright and colorful poster art, I was really excited for this show. I really love genius characters in anime, and having two of them as protagonists seemed almost too good to be true. Unfortunately, Sora and Shiro didn't quite live up to my expectations. While they both turned out to be Gary Stu/Mary Sue-type characters, the biggest problem was NGNL actually takes itself, and by extension its characters, pretty seriously. Sure, there are numerous comedic moments in the show, but those were always brushed aside whenever the real plot kicked in, making the tone rather inconsistent and the characters wholly unbelievable. Plus, the quasi-incest relationship between Sora and Shiro was uncomfortable at best, and icky at worst. I have no moral issues with the subject of incest itself, but too often in anime and manga it's played off as a joke and for fanservice rather than handled well. But then again, I don't really know if there would have been a better way to portray the siblings' relationship, as NGNL constantly fluctuates from being entirely serious to silly and fanservice-laden.\n\nThe plot itself felt rather contrived, as it needlessly forces the \"logic\" behind the games down its viewers' throats one minute and has the main duo peeking at another character's panties the next. I don't mind fanservice occasionally, but NGNL's fanservice was neither tasteful nor funny. Sora's attempts at winning the trust of the female characters is usually just thinly-veiled sexual harassment. I know that's kind of the point, but I just didn't find it entertaining. Also, NGNL likes to trick its viewers into thinking that Sora and Shiro winning game after game is the product of intelligence and logic, when in reality most of the explanations they come up with are completely ridiculous and unrealistic. This would be fine if the show was trying to parody the whole \"ALL ACCORDING TO PLAN\" thing a lot of anime incorporate, except for the fact that NGNL also takes this very seriously, as if everything happening is totally plausible. And in my opinion, the contrast between the fanservice-heavy comedy parts and the relatively serious game/politics parts just doesn't really work too well.\n\nOne of the few redeeming factors of NGNL is its art style, which is quirky, vivid, and all around nice to look at. The animation and music weren't always top-notch, but at least the bright colors and cute character designs made me ignore some of those faults. The art was definitely also unique, as I haven't seen many anime series with that particular use of lighting and color palette.\n\nAll of that being said, I do have to admit that No Game No Life was fun at times. That is, it's the kind of dumb fun that you would enjoy at 2 AM with your brain turned off. And okay, Shiro was pretty cute. But that doesn't change my overall opinion of the series. I don't hate NGNL, but after reading a lot of other reviews and people's opinions on this show (not to mention the current MAL ratings for this show, holy shit) I just couldn't understand why it's so popular and highly regarded. Maybe for some people the idea of a world where everyone plays games to solve problems is their idea of paradise, or maybe the way the main characters defy logic and reason with their wins really gets people's blood pumping. I really don't know. But as for myself, I can only say that although I had some fun with No Game No Life at some points throughout its 12-episode run, it was ultimately not my cup of tea and had many flaws that detracted from what first seemed like an interesting concept.\n\n[Note:] This review was originally written on my blog, and is technically rated a 6.5/10. I'm pretty generous when it comes to ratings, though.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by _mahoushoujos_ (\n16\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 10, 2014\n\nsmallwaves\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Does this show have any sense of tension? Hell no. Curveball plot-twists? Not any that aren't made meaningless in a near instant. Well written or developed characters? Not on your fucking life. So why the hell am I not flat out panning No Game No Life? The answer: It was a wild ride.\n\nI would be lying if I said this show had anything resembling good writing in regards to story, characters, or humor (which is 90% anime/manga references anyhow). What it does have is a premise that gives everyone and their grandma in the universe the license to go full ham. A world where everything\n\n...\n\nis decided by games, even criminal acts such as mugging, lends itself well to the spirit of, God help me for being so casual, \"fun\". The reason to watch is to see just how inane and stupid shit can get, and boy howdy, it doesn't disappoint in keeping an audience entertained. Chess turning into a real-time strategy game? Shiritori: Batshit Insane Version? Sign me up!\n\nTragically, NGNL does have its shortcomings, mostly character related. Sora and Shiro might as well be renamed Gary Stu and Mary Sue with how infallible they are despite their agoraphobia and separation anxieties. There's a difference between having a knack for something and being omnipotent, and they blaze off passing the latter as they vanish into the sunset. While Yami Yugi from the original Yu-Gi-oh! manga also had a very few number of losses to his name, the games were more dangerous, giving them more suspense despite the outcome being obvious. Meanwhile, at the end of every single big match played that MIGHT have looked close, the strat explanations of the Perfect Duo could be best summed up as \"Close? Hell naw I will tell you all 108 reasons why this was actually a curbstomp\". This is ESPECIALLY bad in the shiritori game where they in a mere 20 minutes managed to reinvert the metagame of a word association game. Jibril is not someone who is too terribly interesting on her own, but possible stories of her past in the later seasons (trust me, there will be since this averaged 9K+ sales and even breaking the Manabi Line is like Christmas for Madhouse) may prove for some interesting world-building. For the time being, Steph's purposes including acting as a punching bag first and a plot device second. I guess the big problem with the cast is that their personalities are, in a word, lacking, and you remember them for their gimmicks than any innate traits that aren't linked to a gag or a steadfast maintaining of status quo.\n\nMany of the gags are of the aforementioned sandbagging of Steph, and references to anime, manga, and video games, ranging from JoJo to Yu-Gi-Oh! to Hyouka to Phoenix Wright along with many more. However, they are hit or miss, with the Castle in the Sky reference being the crowning jewel. Aside from that, the rest are pervy jokes with occasional metahumor. Visually, this anime has more bloom than a 7th+ gen FPS title, which is a tragedy as Madhouse is on the high-end when it comes to visually appealing anime. It flattens out everything on the screen, making nothing pop out at you or leave a lasting impression. It's almost a sin to have so much of the background details hidden and drowned out behind an abundance of effects and filters.\n\nOne's ability to enjoy the series hinges ENTIRELY on how much they can put up with characters that wear 50 suits of plot armor before going to bed at night. If wish-fulfillment characters with flaws that fail to attempt to balance them out is enough for you to make you drop a series in an episode or two, stay the hell away from No Game No Life. If you are willing to put up with the asspulls for the concept, sit back, relax, and have fun.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by smallwaves (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMore Reviews\n\nMore\nTop Anime\n\n1\n\nSousou no Frieren\n\n2\n\nFullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood\n\n3\n\nSteins;Gate\n\n4\n\nShingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2\n\n5\n\nOne Piece Fan Letter\n\nMore\nTop Airing Anime\n\n1\n\nKusuriya no Hitorigoto 2nd Season\n\n2\n\nOne Piece\n\n3\n\nTian Guan Cifu Short Film\n\n4\n\nTu Bian Yingxiong X\n\n5\n\nDoupo Cangqiong: Nian Fan\n\nMore\nMost Popular Characters\n\n1\n\nLamperouge, Lelouch\n\n2\n\nMonkey D., Luffy\n\n3\n\nLevi\n\n4\n\nLawliet, L\n\n5\n\nRoronoa, Zoro\n\n\nAbout\n\nPress Room\n\nSupport\n\nAdvertising\n\nFAQ\n\nTerms\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy Settings\n\nDo Not Sell or Share my Personal Information\n\nCookie\n\nNotice at Collection\n\nSitemap\n\nLogin\n\n\nTokyo Otaku Mode\n\nHoneyfeed\n\nManga Store\n\n MyAnimeList.net is a property of MyAnimeList Co., Ltd. ©2025 All Rights Reserved.\n\n This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google \nPrivacy Policy\n and \nTerms of Service\n apply.",

There is an undeniable and indescribable appeal to watching someone psychologically destroy all opponents in their path regardless of how questionable the logic they use to do so truly is. However, unlike its two predecessors, No Game No Life is not a show that demands to be taken seriously. It is light-hearted, comedic, and fun as opposed serious, dark, and intense. This approach, in theory, is a much better way to tackle the “super-smart” protagonist concept\n\n...\n\nbecause it avoids any possibility that the show comes off as pretentious or overly-serious, which were big knocks DN and CG. For this reason, I was very excited for what has become the most hyped anime of the season, and while I found certainly found it to be entertaining, it has a large number flaws that prevent it from living up to the unreasonable hype that the fan base has created for it. It does many things well, but for every thing that it does well, there is something it does poorly.\n\nSynopsis: Two siblings named Sora and Shiro are brilliant NEET, hikikomori gamers who have become legends on the Internet due to how good they are at playing video games under the codename “Blank”. One day, they are summoned by an androgynous being named Tet to an alternate world. Tet, who claims to be God of this world, has prohibited war and declared this to be a world where everything is decided by games, and I mean literally everything. In this world, humanity is only one of 14 other races, all vying for world domination though the act of challenging each other to games. Sora and Shiro, excited by the concept of the world, set off on an epic journey to see just how far their gaming abilities can take them.\n\nThe appeal of No Game No Life comes in the form of how fleshed out and imaginative the setting is, but it is the depth of the world that ultimately also creates significant flaws in it. To elaborate, the plot of this anime can easily be described as tedious; there is SO much explaining that needs to be done. There are 14 different races, some of them can use magic and some of them can’t, they all have a designated “rank”, they play games with each other to decide everything, they can’t murder or cause physical harm to one another, what constitutes a game needs to be specified, the games must follow 10 rules, those rules are called the pledges, some of the pledges have loopholes, some of them don’t, also there’s (*MIND EXPLODES). Top all of this exposition off with the fact that each individual game played in the series has its own unique set of rules that you need to remember and the logic that Sora and Shiro use to win the games they play also needs explaining and what you have is one massive information overload. It is 100% impossible to coherently follow everything that is happening in this series, and that is a fact that has both pros and cons. The cons are obviously the fact that the oversaturation of explanations make the show feel hectic and chaotic at times, but on the pro side, they make the show a lot of fun. Watching Blank massacre their opponent’s using ridiculously unreasonable logic never gets old, and while there are many words to describe the games played in NGNL, “boring” is not one of them. I applaud the show for establishing key plot points and never seeming to lack direction; this is a show that knows exactly what it wants to be in terms of tone and themes, but I’m not a very big fan of the themes they chose to include. At times, the show feels like it is nothing more then shameless otaku pandering and fanservice filler. I cringed as the show used one contrived plot device after another in order to incorporate as many anime fetishes as it possibly could and took every chance it got to throw in a pop-culture reference. The fanservice is also gratuitous, albeit mostly harmless considering the type of show we are dealing with. Overall, NGNL’s plot can best be described as mindless fun. That may sound weird for a show that is grounded on the concept of logic, but it is the simple reality. The series can be flawed and stupid times, but it’s effective.\n\nThe characters of NGNL are fun, but horribly unrealistic. Our protagonists, Sora and Shiro, are too overpowered and not good representations of socially inept NEETs. Drawing comparisons to why I am not a big fan of most shounens, the MCs are obviously protected by plot armor and that takes away from the suspense of the plot; they are simply too perfect. To be fair though, the show does a good job of giving Sora a personality and making him entertaining, but he is a mary-sue. How are these protagonists supposed to be anti-social? If anything, they are charismatic! Sure they have a 10 second comedic panic attack every now and again, but the show does a very poor job of representing what their characters are supposed to be. Shiro, for example, did not impress me at all; her only real traits are that she’s cute and unreasonably smart, so again: mary-sue. She can be funny with her bluntness every now and then, but her entire presence just feels unnecessary; it’s like they wrote this show with Sora as the only protagonist and then the editors added in Shiro to provide loli appeal. The side characters are nothing spectacular either; the only one that I think was well done is Steph because she successfully provided two things that are instrumental to the show’s tone and themes, those being comedic relief and fanservice. Then you have characters like Jibril who are just awful and unbelievably one-dimensional. Jibril is a walking plot-device in every sense of the word; she serves no purpose other than to advance the storyline with her seemingly unrestricted magical powers. Oh, and she also provides fanservice (shockingly). The strange thing is that even though the NGNL characters aren’t all that special, they work decently well. The reason for this phenomenon is that they have good chemistry with one another; you can really sense that Sora and Shiro legitimately care for one another and the show is filled with funny interactions between Blank and the side characters, especially Steph. So in short: the cast of NGNL is far from perfect, but they turned out all right.\n\nDoes NGNL live up to the hype? No, not at all actually, especially considering the fact that this show has been hyped to the point where it is dubbed as a masterpiece for the ages that will be talked about for decades. It’s still a solid anime, but I can’t fathom why this show has become so beloved. It’s funny, over-the-top, way too convoluted, yet fun: nothing special. It’s probably worth a watch provided that you disregard the hype train and go in with reasonable expectations.\n\nAschente!\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Link_of_Hyrule (\n65\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 22, 2015\n\nDenpa_Pope\n\nNot Recommended\nPreliminary\n\n (5/12 eps)\n\n You know people tend to say that first impression is everything. One of the first things No Game No Life throws at you is a detailed panty shot of an eleven year old girl. Still I am a reasonable man. After all more than on one occasion a show made a bad impression but got a lot better afterwords...sadly No Game No Life does not.\n\nThe plot follows duo of brother and sister who are sucked into a world where everything is decided by games. Both wars and killing are banned. The only way to move up the social ledder and ETC is being good at\n\n...\n\ngames. \n\nI have a lot of problems with this anime. While the concept is pretty good the execution is downright horrible. First of all the show lets us know that both protagonists are virtually unbeatable at ANY GAME, succesfully killing any kind of tension for the said games which are basicly the main attarction of the show. Both protagonist are not just good at games, they are parcticly good at almost EVERYTHING. They read emotions, great at manipulating people through dialoge, smart and by that I mean not just game smart, but borderline ridicilously overpowered smart. Forgive me but I have a hard time that an 18 year old virgin who has not friends and plays only games and a girl who does not even leave home posses such skills. \n\nBut that is just the start of the problems. The second main character is Stephie Dola, a girl who's sole purpous is to be dumb and make main character look good. I am not kidding when I say she is dumb. She is like on a level of an average 14 year old girl in smarts departament. Now a point of such characters is often to pass the exposition to a viewer through said character. In this show the protagonists spend a LOT of time expalining most basic things to her which brings down the pacing a lot.\n\nThe pacing itself is utterly broken. At the start it is faster than a speeding bullet with characters not even reacting to getting inside a whole new world. There is niether negative nor positive reaction. Then when the actuall games start the pacing drops to really slow and let me explain why.\n\nThe shows main attraction as I said before is the games and \"Smart\" tactics used by the characters and ETC. The things is the tactics and twists they use in the show are so obvious that it gets extra boring when they are explaining and implementing the twists when I saw them coming 5 minutes before they were used. \n\nSome may say that the pacing issues are coming from the show being given only 12 episodes. Well I say the pacing would be a lot better if they did not spent more time on fanservice than on the ACTUALL GAMES!\n\nThe whole show came off as expremely pretentious. It thinks that it is really smart and thinks outside the box, when in reality it is obvious and very rarely does something surprising. The whole show spents way too much time trying to convince you that the protaginsts are the greatest, smartest, most awesome creatures ever, while in reality they are just overpowered wishfullfilment badly written characters.\n\nThe comedy in the show is downright awful. I never once smiled. Though I have to give credit to voice actors who do their best to make the script sound funny.\n\nI have a few positive things to say too overall. The visuals are good even if they filters they use get in the way a little. Still very nice to look at. The soundtrack is really really good and captures the video game feel very well.\n\nOverall I could barely get through 5 episodes and it felt like an eternity of fanservice, wishfullfilment and bad writing. I know that a lot of people like this show but I was not one of them.\n\nAlso a bath scene with 11 year old girl...\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Denpa_Pope (\n10\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 30, 2015\n\nOkamiden5\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Things I like:\n\n- Original Idea (Not that I care too much about originality)\n\n- Interesting and Colourful World\n\n- Races are cleverly designed\n\n- The plot -> Its an intriguing premise; conquering and banding together nations like its a giant chessboard\n\nThings I hate:\n\n- Too much fanservice -> comedy = fanservice. Can't get over it\n\n- Characters are too OP -> I literally don't fucking care about any games because I know that the main characters are going to win. They are always in FULL CONTROL of the situation. Oh and they never lose in the entire first season. As a matter of fact I often end up cheering for\n\n...\n\nthe other team.\n\n- Characters piss me off -> Characters have exceedingly annoying personalities. They also tend to act like complete douche bags (especially to Steph). I want to punch them in the face in every frame.\n\n- The War -> Why does this back story even exist?\n\n- The theme -> What theme? Playing games 24/7 and being a NEET despite having almost godlike cognitive abilities and capacity for knowledge is a good thing?\n\n-The plot -> They harass Steph, Excessive fanservice, Play a game, Excessive fanservice, They Win the game (No surprise), They harass Steph.\n\nAnd whenever they don't do this it comes off as awkward.\n\nThat's basically it. If I can't appreciate the protagonists, comedy or even the plot. There really is no theme. Everyone except the protagonists are weak and a pushover (Even Tet gets wrecked in the first episode at chess). Everything is too colourful and it gives me cancer. Fucking overrated.

And people wonder why the anime community receives so much hate and scorn and are labeled as \"pedophiles\" and stereotyped as fetishizing little girls.\n\nThere is nothing clever about this show. It's everything Death Note could have done wrong, done wrong. The main characters are already established as being unable to lose, so why become invested in anything they do? They're just gonna win anyway. It doesn't help that the rules of the game aren't even well explained half the time.\n\nWith 11 episodes, there's no room for any\n\n...\n\ncharacter development (not that they tried) and the characters themselves are barely established as people. They're just 2 no-lives who like gaming an unrealistic amount and are placed in a dream-fulfillment reality where you game to win. The concept is promising I guess, and there a few well-executed mind games, but that's as far as the creativity and entertainment stretches after you realize they actually won't lose, no matter what.\n\nI don't really remember anything about the soundtrack (which shows how little impact it had), but I don't claim to be a soundtrack critic. A show should be good without relying on music to boost its score.\n\nThe art and animation is really the only thing the show does right. It was pretty fluid and consistent throughout and the backgrounds were well done. It was too bright and vibrant for my personal taste, but that's all it is, personal taste. It fit well with the fantasy setting, but my eyes didn't care.\n\nThis is a show perfectly tailored for people who want to see some indecent exposure and get a few good perverted giggles out of it and then pretend like it's a masterpiece because it's masquerading as a games anime. \"Let's have an episode entirely dedicated to explaining the rules of the world and showing the consequences for losing. Then let's follow that up with a sauna scene where an 8 year old girl is almost naked as her brother gets hard for her and this other chick\" HAHAHA FUCKING GENIUS WRITING!!! SUPER CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT!!!\n\nOverall: 3/10 (For good art/animation and a few decent games)\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by 0207xander (\n11\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 4, 2014\n\nSocial_Elitist\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n No Game No Life Review:\n\nMindset:\n\nMade by the studio Mad House and watched with no expectations except that it is definite that the original manga was made in Brazil. \n\nSynopsis:\n\nTwo fabled NEET sibling gamers get conveyed in a fantasy realm when all what you do is play games then soon purchasing the bed for Your Harem and triumph everything as a crazy empowerment fantasy never to be taken a tad seriously with convuleted strategies that is potentially metalogic by the intelect of the human psyche but proviedes a smirk- consequently making you hallucinate fluffy rainbows- consequently\n\n...\n\nmaking you feel like its the epic journey of life.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nIndeed it is a necessity to notify that you do not watch this show for the story, it tries to convince you to think deeply but the reality is that the show is mostly dependant on woeful moments. And I might as well state that is the best show that made itself as a pure empowerment fantasy pandering over the Otaku audience because it got a majority of corrections. It was much more self-aware, the characters (as how much I want to bash them) served there purpose for there entertainment value. The story however; is to be described bluntly, was to move along everything and it is the entertainment variable which has transformed as the driving factor, not the plot! Which is not disappointing, on the other hand it really gives you the feeling that the world DisBoard is actually magical, majestic, golden and it makes you think that you just ate the burnt tobacco leaves mixed with purple shrooms and whisky, the Animation is the best I've seen from mad house (personally I find it better than wolf children) being definitly above average, oh how much You and I will love the extra effort by giving it a large range of colours making you love magical LSD. The fanservice is rahter extreme and some scenes are sitting next to the border line, You have clothes completely oblidarted, plot devices for female cosplay or even taking advantage by the laws of Disboard to show feisty fetishes. If You are not into that, then be prepared to be lashed out.\n\n The characters were fairly well done overall as how much as I want to bash the archetypes, it seemed fittting for Sora's conquest to also increase the population density of he's Harem and in the critical eye it seemed to be a tad more tolerable, but archetypes, are still archetypes.\n\nAnd this is how we should split the cake, everything to the sound, animation, (okay maybe not the sound) but the overall narrative and presence of the show reflects towards the fact that this show is not for everyone! Its pandering purely over the Otaku demographic as the whole thing seemed like an Otaku's fantasy realm and it was there to be a destination when one seeks out the deviating and guilty pleasure piece of fiction. For those who are not too much into anime and would rather hunt down for plot and characterization then it all boils down into a bad show. Either You call this “The best thing next to Shrek” Or “A piece of nude rubbish”\n\nReplicated towards the reflection of the characters, they can become rather likeable at a short time span because of there silliness despite being archetypes and are not at all deep and four dimensional and are idealized by the Otaku mind thus making them undefeated. They are goofy at almost everything else but when playing a game there on Godmode, they do not develop and change through out the duration while simultaneously staying virgin. Nothing is “Ever” to be taken seriously at any specs of the imagination. In the world of Disboard, everything thrives by Idealism and Imagination, doing the impossible without difficulty and not being able to wash the dishes in our mundane reality.\n\nLEGACY:\n\nIt's dum entertainment, erotic, overall very idealistic and delusional. Only stated and viewed as “Magical” by again; your local Otaku and intentionally not targeting the minds of those who watch too much Disney and Pixar. And I suppose you could like it if your eyes on fan service has reduced into saying that this is the new rule of cool.\n\nCRITICAL SCORE:\n\n6/10 – Epic-ish story of Otaku fantasy\n\n6/10 – Archetypes used well to further emphasise the escapism\n\n7.5/10 – LSD visual animation, further immerses You into another world.\n\n7/10 – Orchestras FTW.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Social_Elitist (\n46\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 8, 2014\n\nGonzyChan\n\nRecommended\n\n Flourishing aesthetics come a long way in holding a show up from just being average or forgettable. Sometimes loving a show for its robust and energetic personality can be a blessing and a curse. Then again, it all comes down to the show’s purposeful existence to help distinguish how an anime should be viewed. It wants to be a fun and stupid show with the only intention of being provocative or a thought-provoking show with a deep narrative. Now that shouldn’t be said to excuse it entirely on the numerous faults it might have, but with a show like No Game No Life, it is\n\n...\n\none of the instances where you can’t help but admire its silliness.\n\nWith that all said, No Game No Life is not what you would call a “masterpiece,” as many would love to build this up to be. While the entertainment factor pulls through the most out of any experience, it cannot be forgiven for how low-quality it tries to implement a story. That, in turn, comes from the fact that there’s not much of a story to digest in No Game No Life. It is just a plot that follows two NEET MMO players thrown into a virtual reality where they play games to become rulers of this virtual world. There is hardly any suspenseful pull in getting invigorated in it because it is insanely predictable in every game outcome. I know from the beginning that Sora and Shiro will win all the way through, so why should I be invigorated in it to begin with?\n\nIt is a real shame that it does not bother to create a cohesive narrative to follow from point A to point B. Especially with the amount of creativity, it brings to the overall cast. Granted, they are not, what I would call “magnificent” in development, but what makes up for it is their significant energy and charm. This all comes from their witty dialogue and fantastic designs that have unique styles to whatever emotion they are portraying. It would be easier to dissect the main cast individually because it will put my argument into context with my feelings about them.\n\nOur main protagonists, Sora and Shiro, are inseparable siblings on who the writers are pulling the brother and sister relationship card. I will argue that, by themselves, they are incredibly bland and atypical in their archetypes. However, they are quite an entertaining duo when they are together, thanks to their chemistry and hilarious interludes between one. It helps more on Sora’s side that he does pack in great charisma thanks to Yoshitsugu Matsuoka’s fabulous voice acting. On the other hand, Shiro has Ai Kayano on her side, which is mostly just playing her as Shiina 2.0; nothing special in the slightest.\n\nThen we get to Stephanie Dora, and it may be controversial to say this, but she is by far the most entertaining of the cast. The main reason is Yoko Hikasa’s voice acting, who is having such a freaking ball with voicing for this character. Her exceptional ability to show great dignity to her voice and suddenly become a raving maniac in the next second shows her talent in full throttle. Many people may have a point in criticizing Steph for being both an intelligent girl and a stupid one in other scenarios. My response would be how No Game No Life has so many silly elements to its comedy that it fits perfectly with the tone. This makes her archetype more forgiving since we often see female characters of this magnitude several times, but these two great qualities make her all the more lovable. Also, she dresses up as a puppy, and we get to hear Yoko Hikasa bark like one. Need I say more?\n\nFinally, there is Jibril, who was hard to get into at first glance. But once she went on and more funny moments came along, she later became on par with Steph in entertaining qualities. This is Yukari Tamura at her best. We don’t ever get to see her voice females with perverted personalities. When she does, she is just heavenly every time. What eventually led me to like her more was how she seemed to possess the same fun qualities that Steph had in personality shifts from time to time.\n\nWhat does stand out for No Game No Life’s credit to make it more interesting than most shows of its caliber is its art and animation. The extreme usage of over-saturated colors gives it its look from the original creator and character designer, Yuu Kamiya. His name under the cast and crew had me hesitant initially, seeing he was also involved with Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi, one of my most hated shows. Luckily this was not anything that levels awful, and the artwork stood on its own. However, it could’ve worked better if the color palette had been emphasized less and made more consistent for a better viewing experience.\n\nNow, do you like fun entertainment as much as I do? If yes, then No Game No Life is one show that only cares about being a fun show from beginning to end. Is it perfect for bringing forth these enjoyable moments on full display? Not necessarily, but if anything, No Game No Life is at that level of entertainment to be respectable in giving forth reasonable effort. It incorporates fun action sequences with flashy animation and delivers incredibly hysterical comedy in one package. Not many anime can achieve the difficulty of balancing both aspects to significant effect, which No Game No Life accomplishes this feat. Though the action and games can be predictable as to who’ll win in the long run, the journey is at least fun for the ride.\n\nWith the advent of VRMMO anime being in full force at the moment, it is likely we won’t see the light at the end of the tunnel for this phase in anime history. The popularity of No Game No Life clearly shows this. While its qualities do not come on par with its impact, it is by no means wrong by its very nature. Once you can find some great substance in entertainment that in and of itself justifies it as being good, if it comes to showing off these same instances of cliches without any significance in the future, I would be hugely worried.\n\nGrade: B\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by GonzyChan (\n101\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 28, 2014\n\nACutePain\n\nRecommended\n\n No Game No Life, which ended a short time ago as of this writing, is at its heart a polarizing anime. It's not that it has really controversial content, or that it breaks a lot of new ground that is hard for people to stomach, but rather that this show is quite simple when it comes down to it. On the upside, it has a refreshing spin to a rather trite formula, but on the other side, there are flaws you cannot ignore in this anime. It is an enjoyable ride, however, if you can look past this.\n\nThe basic premise of NGNL\n\n...\n\nas it's commonly referred to by fans, is that the main characters, Sora and Shiro, are an unstoppable force in the gaming community in real life. At the beginning of the anime they are teleported to a world where games are literally cosmic rules, where winning or losing a game can determine the fate of your soul, or whatever thing you bet. It is quite thorough so far in exploring the rules that this world operates in, as well as every conceivable way in and around those rules, especially by the many races that inhabit it, who all have some form of 'cheat' or magic or special ability that gives them an edge over Imanity, humanity's stand-in.\n\nThe aforementioned setup is without a doubt the biggest strength of NGNL. It explores this setting with a 'monster of the week' formula, that, with interesting spins on the situation reminiscent of the stronger entries in the shounen genre, doesn't really disappoint at any part. It sets up these situations well, and paces them throughout the anime with an appropriate degree of aplomb, proving for a really smooth ride for viewing. This anime is easy to watch and doesn't go an episode without giving the viewer something new and interesting.\n\nAnother strong point is that it is quite well-animated. I cannot comment for its adaptation of the light novels art, as I have not read the light novel, but in either case, it fills in all the gaps nicely. The animation has a colorful tint, as well as a lot of rather unique and eye-catching character designs. Most aspects of this anime are pleasing on the eye, and far from being a lip-flapping exercise, as some anime with a knack for mind-games might turn out to be when animated at their worst, there's a lot going on, and it's all animated pretty fluidly to my eye.\n\nThat is not to say that it does not misstep however, it just doesn't so in the manner that many anime fall prey to. As a counter to the interesting and varied setups I mentioned earlier, a lot of the characters feel rather...dull. This can't really be attributed to bad character design in any way, in fact, there's a rather diverse cast of characters, but rather, it is that most of them fit into a mold seen before, and done better before. That isn't to say there is no room for development, you do get a glimpse into what might be for some of these characters, whose motivations are viewed briefly, but they aren't really tested for the most part, and there's a lot of one-bit villains, apart from one human the main characters face early on.\n\nIn addition, the main characters are, I'm going to say this frankly, Mary Sues. For those unfamiliar with the term, a Mary Sue is a character who is overly perfect. There are a lot of different types, but the essential nature of all of them comes down to their unbelievability as a character. Sora and Shiro are pretty much unbeatable, showing a level of planning that verges on omniscient. This isn't entirely bad in of itself. The antagonists' reactions to 'Blank' (Their pseudonym) completely predicting every one of their moves, can be entertaining, but it does rob the show of a good deal of conflict. There are a couple token attempts to create some tension, but on the whole, they fail to really hit the mark, and you never think that the pair will ever really fail, and that's the biggest mark this show has against it.\n\nOn that note, however, I will say this. There may be room for this to get better, and I am tentatively anticipating that. As this is based on an ongoing Light Novel series, there is room for more development, especially since this seems to be the authors first work, according to this site. On its own though, NGNL is riddled with a few problems, but an entertaining ride throughout, and I still highly recommended it, just on the aspect that it is unique, and it has plenty of places to go.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by ACutePain (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 20, 2014\n\nok_\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n The most well known tenant of psychology is that human are tremendously social creatures. The most powerful motivation to see an anime is that you're friends and all the people in MaL are seeing it. Consequently, word-of-mouth is the most important marketing tool. There is no question that for this season NGNL was the most talked about anime of 2014 thus far. It was more than a show. It was an event that could not be missed. A second tenant of psychology is that viewers want to relate to the protagonists situation and see him 'suddenly change/succed'. Sora (the protagonist of the show) is depicted\n\n...\n\nas honorable, independent, moral, selfless, sensitive ~ positive traits that appeal to audiences. Also he is uneducated, socially anxious, burdened and a NEET. Wait, what?? Where did this traits come from? I'l tell you. These traits came orientated towards the second tenant I mentioned. From the description of MaL any Grade 6 can articulate the fact that this show transforms a NEET into a hero. It provides an 'escapism' to the users telling them in any hole you are in whether your a NEET, beta or alpha, there will be a place where you can expose your untapped potential (granted this place doesn't exist). \n\nA true \"underdog\" story. \n\nThis review is directed towards anyone who is planning or considering on watching Madhouses' new production 'No Game No Life' AND WHO HAVE READ THE SYNOPSIS.

Press images and type in \"No Game No Life.\" What do you see from those neon over-saturated pictures? You see the hype everyone is talking about. Do you know what I see. Pictures resembling other pictures of anime that are ranked from 1000-5000 on this site. So why is this anime #19? Let me answer this. It certainly isn't the background art that took 30 minutes to make for the first 3 episodes, it isn't the soundtrack that splintercell or Origa isn't making. \n\nIt's what I call U~ōrusutorīto' [ウォールストリート]. When you take an underdog and grant him the ability to to the impossible. No Game No Life works on the two tenants I mentioned with an added element. It surprises the audience by the sheer intelligence/gambling the protagonist makes. NGNL involves a protagonist who bets large objects, and when shit hits the fan and he is about to lose a suddent element is added that makes him win. \n\n//Formula Program for No Game No Life\n\n#include \n\n#include //deprecated.

That sounds interesting, but unfortunately, it's not as good as it could seem.\n\nStory:\n\nThe main focus of the story is obviously the games played by Sora and Shiro, our main characters, to come closer to their objective. And while it seems interesting at first, it quickly becomes clear that they will all be solved in a similar way, which is without much logic at all. As the protagonists will state several times, they win as soon as the game starts, because they are that good. So, what happens during\n\n...\n\nthe game doesn't really matter. There is no real tension, because even if it seems like Sora and Shiro could lose, you know they won't. You know that after some time, they will pull out of nowhere an explanation of why they had won since the beggining and why their opponent is stupid.\n\nThe time between the different games is spent on discussing the politics of the world and the tactics that should be used to conquer it, which is in fact not bad. It would be even better, though, if it wasn't punctuated by awfully long and frequent bath scenes.\n\nCharacters:\n\nWe officially have two protagonists, but it's not long before we figure out that one of them is a main character in name only.\n\nSora, our first main character, is extremely arrogant and always trying to show how much better he is than any other character. Indeed, he is very smart and good at bluffing, and his attitude could probably be understood if those two qualities weren't the only one he possessed. Instead, this permanent tendency to show off for no good reason makes Sora a very unlikable character. But we haven't talked yet about what could be Sora's most important trait: his inability to make a mistake. Everything Sora says is true and if someone thinks otherwise, they'll be proven wrong sooner or later. If Sora seems to be loosing, it's only an illusion, because he always wins. Convenient, right?\n\nThe other main character is Shiro, Sora's younger sister, who handles the more mathematical sides of their games. Or at least, once in a while, to remember the audience she's supposed to be the main character alongside her brother. Most of the time, Shiro is actullay just there for the loli fanservice and to show her unbreakable love towards Sora, without doing anything of much importance.\n\nGravitating around our two protagonists, are various female characters who are either forgettable or annoying. Indeed, my favourite character is actually Stephanie, which is saying something since the poor girl's only purpose is to look stupid in comparison to Sora and Shiro and, of course, to be used for fanservice.\n\nVisuals:\n\nWhen it comes to the visual aspect of the show, the first thing that catches the attention is the colour palette that has been used. Primarly composed of blue, pink and purple, it really brings out the feeling of being in an other world and creates a dream-like atmosphere. The are times, however, when I felt like it was just too bright to still be pretty, so while I think using those colours was a very good idea, slightly toning them down might have made everything a bit more agreeable to the eye.\n\nAs for the rest, some sceneries were really pretty, and the animation and art were generally fine.\n\nSound:\n\nBoth the opening and ending were very good, as was the voice acting. The ost was fine, but not particularly memorable.\n\nEnjoyment:\n\nI enjoyed No Game No Life, to a certain extent. If you try to forget about the lack of logic in the winning of the games and simply focus on the immediate action, trying to immerse yourself in it, you will probably find this anime extremely entertaining, like it seem many people do. But as soon as you stop caring about what happens, and just sit there contemplating Sora's arrogance and Shiro's lack of emotion, waiting for the explanation of how they won their game to come out of nowhere, you will get bored.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Vaniltea (\n3\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nDec 26, 2014\n\nTheAzureSky\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n Smart, fun premise. You’ll keep watching to see how they solve the problems, but there’s too much fan service and not enough tension.\n\n★★☆☆\n\nImagine a fantasy world where there’s no war or crime. All conflicts are solved through games. You have an issue? You bet on it. This was the first episode, and it had me hooked. What a great idea. I’m going to watch a smart show about smart characters who use smart ideas instead of powering up for 10 episodes and punching the shit out of each other.\n\nAnd what I got was some of that, but mostly fan service.\n\nThe two main characters declared they\n\n...\n\nwould never lose at any game. So naturally the most interesting direction you can that take is to put them through situations where they can or will lose. You should always have bigger obstacles than your characters can handle. This is character development and makes stories exciting.\n\nThey’re also described as NEETs and hikikomori. NEETs are young people who are “Not in Education, Employment or Training” while hikikomori are adolescents or adults that are extremely withdrawn from society, shutting themselves at home for years. This would’ve made for interesting character development except it never has any bearing on the plot. There’s no growth or change from being a NEET or hikikomori. It’s just tacked on as a shallow way to relate to its audience.\n\nThere’s also too much fan service. The other characters aren’t much more than wish fulfillment and are there to look good. Except there’s nothing inherently wrong with fan service. The issue here is that it’s taking the place of genuinely good story telling and character development. If the characters had more depth I wouldn’t have minded.\n\nLook, I get it. You can make really interesting, unique works, but it’s risky. Or you can make something with proven appeal and pulls in revenue. Anime is already a struggling industry where only the hardcore fans (otaku) command the market with their money. It’s capitalism, and there’s nothing wrong with that. So I have hard time faulting No Game No Life for pandering. It’s a struggle between letting the work stand on its own and taking into account external factors like the consumer market.\n\nWhat I do have issue with is people overrating it. The fun of the show comes from the main characters solving what seems to be impossible challenges. In their fantasy world, humans are the lowest ranked civilization. This was a good choice, but each episode’s puzzle or conflict isn’t solved in a satisfying way. It only SEEMS clever, and the way it’s solved isn’t natural. It felt like the writer worked backwards instead of building off progressively harder obstacles.\n\nThis is the same issue I had with the TV show House M.D. There’s a medical mystery, the show spends an hour dancing around it, House has an epiphany, and it’s solved. The medical issue is solved when the writers say it’s solved. The show is still fun, though, and House is a great character.\n\nI do love the premise as it invites stories around tactics and strategy instead of who has more chakra or the higher power level. The art is vibrant and colorful. Everything has a dreamy glow to it. Even with all my issues with it, the show was still entertaining, and I don’t regret finishing it.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheAzureSky (\n28\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 7, 2015\n\naznkirby\n\nRecommended\n\n Welcome to No Game No Life! Where violence is forbidden and you play games with others to decide simple wagers from your pet dog or your crappy bagged lunch to bigger prizes like your life and perhaps the future of humanity! \n\nWith a premise like that, it's no wonder why NGNL attracted so many viewers in the 2014 anime year and it truly does not disappoint. With elements of action, ecchi, superb art, brain power, and amazing amounts of lolis. NGNL is one of the shining points of the 2014 crop and I recommend it to those who enjoy a straightforward story of gamers entering\n\n...\n\na world that is not freaking Sword Art Online. \n\nStory: 9, An outstanding story line is presented with a strong parallel to Kamiya's manga adaption. Vivid descriptions of plot and underlying meanings behind all of Sora and Shiro's actions make the series even more enticing. Every character, every motion, every decision has a purpose behind it and a viewer can understand with confidence that an action isn't done just for the screentime but rather for a designated reason. The setting is novel and the premise is simply unlike any other animes which gives the viewer a brand new look and viewpoint.\n\nArt: 10, I'm a big fan of art in anime and many of the highly ranked 2014 animes and even modern animes have adapted to stunning visuals and breathtaking imagery. Details of characters, to background scenes, to even the art on some of the mini games that the MC's play is accentuated to a surprisingly minute detail. Unfortunately, sometimes anime producers will slack on the plot and try to make up for it in the artwork category but this is not the case in NGNL. By coupling art along with a strong story, both categories held to point and a great series is made even greater. \n\nSound: 8, While interesting in plot and art, sound lacked the extra OOMPH that I would've liked. Sad themes and happier melodies were not brought out in key moments and overall music was stagnant at times. That being said, music was not an overall failure, the OP and ED for NGNL are fantastic and the OP in and of itself is a piano masterpiece that I am still struggling to play today. (seriously though, that piece is hard man ^_^)\n\nCharacter: 8, Character development is hard to do in 12 episodes and it was somewhat evident in NGNL. While most people won't complain about surface characterizations and ulterior motives, it would have been nice to know about Steph's background and the other races rather than dive right into the action immediately with very little prior description. With this in mind, it is not as if characters were simply skimmed over. We are given in depth looks at their relationships and especially the strong bond between Shiro and Sora throughout multiple events that test their connection as a family. \n\nEnjoyment: 10, hilarious lines like your a \"steph\"(play on steph's stupidity compared to super-geniuses Sora/Shiro) and Sora's fixation to panties of all kinds make this series exciting and lighthearted when it needs to be. Although I find myself a fan of romance genre, I do like to dip my toes into other genres as well to get the full anime experience. NGNL had a lot of fan-service featuring questionably aged characters but nothing much different than some of the other ecchi animes out there. My only regret was that the season was so short and I hope that there is another one coming out this year or next!\n\nThrow a brotha a like!

The story thrusts the NEET protagonists, Sora and Shiro, into a new world that makes use of their extreme talent in games since quite literally everything is determined by the outcome of a variety of games the world's inhabitants play. This setting is quite refreshing since many anime simply throw NEET protagonists into the video game world (or something of a similar nature) they have been obsessing over, such as Sword Art Online, Log Horizon, Btooom!, and Accel World. NGNL could have easily taken that route, especially with the protagonists' insane MMORPG skills demonstrated at the beginning; yet NGNL decided to make an entire new world that wasn't restricted by MMORPG parameters, but rather by a set of 10 laws that a \"God\" has created. The other races of the world also present an interesting aspect to the show, emphasizing that all other races appear to be superior in their own way with the exception of Imanity (the world's version of humanity) in regards of playing games. Instead of each race presenting similar challenges to the protagonists, the races throw a variety of difficult obstacles at Shiro and Sora since each race will base the game they play on one that is well-suited to their race's unique abilities. \n\nIn addition, NGNL was being able to maintain its long, over-arching story of Shiro and Sora trying to beat the God of the world that put them there in the first place, not getting sidetracked with other subplots that would have been far less satisfying. \n\nThe pacing was also done very well considering only 12 episodes were aired - not too much was packed into the plot so that what the audience is left is is a jumbled mess that falls on top of itself, and not too little is shown that the audience is bored out of their skulls. Each episode brought a new surprise and problem that was a great enjoyment to watch. And much to my pleasure, there were many moments that sent shivers of excitement and anticipation whenever Sora or Shiro's plans started to become more and more evident - these feelings were strikingly similar to those I experienced while watching Code Geass whenever Leleouch demonstrated his high intellect. I almost couldn't help but either smirk as if I were Shiro himself watching his opponents gasp in disbelief or have my jaw drop. It was nice to relive such a stimulating experience.\n\nHowever, there were some moments in the story that I found to be questionable as the story progressed. The conclusions of many major games were highly enjoyable, but there were some conclusions that I felt were simply far too convenient for it to justify the intense buildup that occurred in previous episodes. Additionally, I felt as though there was a tad bit too much fan service. Now I do realize that fanservice is a big aspect of the anime culture, but with the story as it is and its excellent progress, I actually felt as if the fan service was slightly out of place. Traditionally, while fanservice is specifically designed to please the viewers, I felt like NGNL really could have done without it. If anything, I felt that it detracted from the show. \n\nArt: 10\n\nNGNL's art is definitely another reason to admire the show. The very fluid and great animation was done by Madhouse, who were also the ones who helped animate Wolf Children. So it didn't come as a great surprise that the art would do the story justice. The art is very bright, vibrant, and displays a huge array of colors. The show did a great job of shifting the very epic, serious scenes with some of the more comedic or explanatory chibi-style scenes without detracting from the plot. \n\nSound: 9\n\nThe soundtrack was composed by Shinji Hosoe (who runs Super Sweeo) along with his long time collaborator Ayako Saso and several others. Shinji Hosoe was responsible for composing the soundtrack of 999, (a Nintendo DS visual novel game) a personal favorite of my library. The soundtrack did its part well, providing analytical-esque, techno music during scenes where strategies were discussed and very soft pieces during the more touching moments. But most notably, we can see that Super Sweep emphasized a lot of their music on the driving, epic soundtracks. One of the most memorable songs is probably Coulomb's Force, which is played when the pinnacle of the game is reached and when the protagonists' plans are finally revealed. \n\nThe music by itself was able to send shivers down my spine when I first heard it. \n\nCharacter: 8\n\nThe show offers an interesting cast and has very strong lead characters; and surprisingly, despite the short nature of the show, a substantial amount of characters were able to have their backstories revealed on the show. But as the backstories were short themselves, there is still not as much investment and sympathy for the more supporting characters of the show.\n\nAs many others have easily pointed out, Sora is reminiscent of Lelouch at many times whenever he plays a game and is orchestrating different tactics to throw off the enemy; however, he also has a very comical and non-serious side that balances out the complete bad-assery he demonstrates throughout the show. His sense of humor is quite unique as it can switch from being snarky and sarcastic to simply self-deprecating and embarrassing. It is far more easier to relate to Sora since he is far more human than many other protagonists - he has flaws. Shiro is a bit less relatable than Sora is, but that doesn't seem to detract too much from her character. Shiro is highly analytical and quiet. And while she may not have a loud voice, her impressive, quick calculations speak far bigger volumes and often become the highlight of many game conclusions. She's very quick to criticize Sora and will not hesitate to force Sora to reflect on his actions whenever he is close to making a mistake. \n\nBut the charm of Sora and Shiro's characters shine their brightest when both come together as a team - \"Blank\". Sora and Shiro's sibling relationship are the highlight of the show. Shiroa and Sora, despite having an age difference, treat each other equally - which really helps add on to the idea that the two of them are two halves of one whole team. Not to mention that Shiro's computative abilities combined with Sora's quick thinking and impressive behavioral reading skills make them seem almost impervious to any game thrown at them, like a God. NGNL does an excellent job of being able to both show off both of the siblings' skills individually and demonstrate the gargantuan power of their unity. \n\nThe supporting characters, such as Steph and Jibril, provide much of the story's fanservice and comic relief; however, they do have major contributions to the plans that Sora and Shiro construct, whether it be in a game or in simple politics, which make them an integral addition to the sibling's journey of defeating the God of their world. \n\nOverall: 8\n\nNo Game No Life is a wonderful addition to the anime library with its simplistic, yet enthralling story that has each episode enthusiastically volunteering itself to become a puzzle piece that continually adds to the full picture. The entire show has felt like a series of chess moves that push towards the long awaited moment where Sora and Shiro finally place the God in check. \n\nWhile I typically find many shows that follow such storytelling to eventually fall on its face and trip into a convoluted mess, I was pleasantly surprised to find that No Game No Life steps up where others have failed.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Ixact (\n8\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 11, 2015\n\nBlobbertMcN\n\nRecommended\n\n No Game No Life is another one of those light-novel adaptations about a someone, or in this case two someones, being thrown into a game world. And you know what? It's completely fine, 100%. I'm not going to deduct points because it's wish-fulfillment, fiction is supposed to be escapism. Hell, even though I'm not a fan of fanservice, it doesn't make that anime any worse for simply having it - it depends on how they utilize it. But hey, let me break it down:\n\n~STORY~\n\nNGNL's story is, for lack of a better phrase, a slightly more imaginative take on the now very common story of 'people\n\n...\n\ngo into a game world'. Rather, instead of being stuck in a game world where you're essentially living in a video game, health bars and skill trees included; NGNL's world is one that is run BY games. Want to do something that would normally be done by violence? Nope, play a game to decide the outcome instead! This difference in plot compared to similar shows of its kind is what gives NGNL more possibilities. Add magic (Since it is a fantasy world) and you can make these games as complicated (or convoluted) as you like. When the brother-sister, NEET, gaming genius pair are brought into the fantasy world they are finally able to shine with their gaming abilities (See where the wish-fulfillment comes from?). The overall story is... pretty simple. \"What\" will be done is predictable, but \"how\" they do it is a completely different, and that's where NGNL's actual GAMES come into play.\n\nThe games that are played in NGNL are... interesting. This is where opinions will vary when discussing NGNL. I personally like Liar Game style games, and NGNL does have that sort of out-think your opponent mindset in most of its games. However, there is a point where cleverness (like the Shiritori game, my favorite) turns into 'Really? I know it's fiction but REALLY??'. Depending on your tolerance levels for that sort of thing, where you've thought 200 steps ahead several days before something even takes place (exaggeration, but not by much), will determine how you enjoy them.\n\n~ART~\n\nYou know what? I really enjoy the art of NGNL. The backgrounds look pretty, the fantasy world looks nice and the effects that they give to the more magical elements is just fine. The character designs are a bit... standard, I guess is the word I'd use. Moe-blob loli's; big-breasted, large-eyed girls; and a male protagonist looks like a cross between Steins;gate and Bakemonogatari's protagonists. But where the art in NGNL really shines, and I mean REALLY is the colouring. Oh man it looks great and shiny and clean and oh I just love it~\n\n~SOUND~\n\nNo tracks I particularly care about, but it did fit and it worked fine. Nothing outstanding, nothing terrible.\n\n~CHARACTERS~\n\nLet me set aside the main character and get to the side characters first...\n\nThey're just kind of okay. There. I said it. The princess girl, angel girl, mysterious anti-hero (sorta) girl and elf girl are all just okay. One is bad at games but means well, one pursues knowledge and is a pervert, one seems to be a 'baddie' but is misunderstood and can't trust the protagonist, one is... uhh... almost completely undefined but she knows magic so yay. They'll get stripped and be embarrassed, blush and dress provocatively and whatever. They can be funny, they can be annoying, but what they don't do is be any more than average side characters that will either endear or annoy you based on their quirks.\n\nThe main pair Sora and Shiro, together known as the blank, are a little better. First Shiro, the moe-blob, imouto genius girl; she's cute, she's (unexpectedly) bad-ass, and she was actually pretty fun. Aside from all the genius stuff, I'd say her personality is more like a kitten, all cute and cuddly and cute and cute. Yeah okay, she's cute. She's also 11, so I wish I didn't get so many panty-shots of her. Sora is, however, my favourite character with the widest range of expression. Yeah, he's a straight up NEET and pervert, a strategist that thinks a hundred turns ahead, he'll suddenly get bursts of confidence and he'll have moments where he gives nice little speeches. But above all, he's fun. In lots of shows about playing games, often you see hardly anyone having 'fun', but not NGNL. Sora has fun, so I have fun. The interactions between the two are also very enjoyable, and they nicely highlight each others character differences. The two of them certainly aren't deep, but they're enjoyable to watch.\n\n~ENJOYMENT~\n\nIf it weren't for the two protagonists being a enjoyable, I feel like I would've enjoyed the show a lot less. If it went the Yu-gi-oh! route of game playing where everyone is serious despite playing games all the time, the show would've certainly fell flat. However, NGNL is fun, and it is enjoyable, and it gets it. It understands that, despite often high stakes, they're playing games and they're having fun (well, the main characters anyway). So well done NGNL.\n\n~OVERALL~\n\nI like a well written story and well written characters, and to be honest, this show has neither. But it has a solid core that allows for variety, it has energy, and it has fun. And hey, it tells you that it's going to have fun from the get go, so props to it. So while I can't say it is a \"great\" anime, it is definitely an enjoyable one. I'll be watching for a second season.\n\nToodles~\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by BlobbertMcN (\n12\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nOct 4, 2014\n\nde_nukie\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n I just finished watching this at the time of writing this review (literally several minutes), so its pretty fresh in my mind.\n\nThe first thing that you'll notice about this series is the art. It has a strange color scheme, giving it a very fantasy-style vibe, but also gives it the air of a dream sequence. The colours are bright and smooth, and quite unique. You might be put off by this, by I felt that it was a nice attempt at something different.\n\nThe set pieces are quite nice, with huge chess pieces in the background and vast kingdoms and buildings. On a smaller scale, however,\n\n...\n\nthe designs for all the characters are quite bland and unoriginal. The art and animation is good quality, but they aren't really special, and Shiro's mouth shape just seems weird to me.\n\nAnother thing is how most of the women happen to have very large breasts (one character's breasts appear to grow after she removes her top). There are plenty of bath-scenes, and although the nudity isn't that graphic, I would not recommend watching this series in front of anybody who respects you.\n\nI felt that the characters were a big pitfall in this series. The two MCs that are introduced at the start come off as arrogant, and unbelievable. They go on about how all games they participate in are 'won before they even begin.' They are then spruced up with Shiro being superhumanly intelligent (being able to perform ridiculous physics calculations in seconds, and learning a new language without instruction through reading a book that she picked up), and even Sora being insanely intelligent.\n\nAt the other end of the scale is Stephanie, another leading character, who seems to be unbelievably stupid. She is stated to be very intelligent, yet she falls for obvious tricks, even after deep analysis.\n\nThroughout the entire series, there was only one character who I did not dislike/hate.\n\nMy one big gripe about the story is how everything has to be so convoluted. Its not very difficult to follow, its just so unnecessarily complex. Imagine Death Note, but without the back-and-forth plays between Light and L, instead just having one side going 'I'm a genius! Check out how I planned everything! I'm better than you!!' That's pretty much what happens in every conflict, with the MCs essentially giving out that speech every time. This problem is only made worse when you (very quickly) realise that all that deep thought and master-planning wasn't actually necessary, and could have been achieved far quicker, or that the losers lost because that were just too stupid to (fairly easily) not fall into the trap, or just too arrogant to win quickly and simply. Not only that, but a lot of the seemingly deep planning is actually really predictable an d obvious. Honestly, the show just tried too hard to seem smart.\n\nIn terms of sound, I thought the voice acting was okay, but I'm just not really a fan of that cheery pop-music (which happens to be in most anime). If you like that music, you won't have a problem with this.\n\nPersonally, the problems with the characters and the plot, and the resolution of every single conflict made this a drag for me to sit through.\n\nArt: 7\n\nSound: 7\n\nStory: 4\n\nCharacters: 5\n\nEnjoyment: 4\n\nOverall: 5\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n5\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by de_nukie (\n11\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 29, 2014\n\njizzaloo\n\nRecommended\n\n Once upon a time, there was a boy who watched an anime series and fell in love.\n\nLovestruck, he scrutinized the reactions of other people watching the anime, and the positive reviews and high ratings brought a smile to his face :)\n\nBut alas, just as the anime scrolls had foretold, the smart-alecks eventually started watching the anime.\n\nThey had heard the legends about this anime's greatness, and screamed:\n\n\"No! All anime must have flaws.\n\nIf an anime is a 10, it's against the laws!\n\nI'm a self-absorbed git that needs to get a life!\n\nI must rate this anime as lower than a 5!\n\nPeople call this anime good? That definitely won't\n\n...\n\ndo.\n\nOh look here! A panty shot! A flash of boobs too!\n\nMy nose-bleed can't handle it! Let's give it a four.\n\nOh wait, no wait! There is even more...\n\nThe story actually involves humans? How unoriginal!\n\nIt's just like that other anime. They practically copied it all!\n\nNow that we have another excuse, let's just give it a three.\n\nI actually secretly enjoyed it, but keep that between you and me.\n\nWe are the \"real\" reviewers. Oh my gawd I'm so smart!\n\nRather than watch anime, you should hear my brain fart!\"\n\nOnce they found the tiny blemishes of the anime called \"originality\" and \"fan-service\".\n\nThey decided that nothing else mattered, and started hating on the anime.\n\nSeeing all this, the poor boy cried out rivers of sorrow.\n\nHe tried desperately to defend his beloved anime, but the haters called him a fan-boy and ignored him.\n\nBut after watching the anime a second time, the boy wiped off his tears.\n\nHe knew the anime was great, and decided to show it in a review.\n\nAnd so it starts...\n\nIf you haven't caught on by now, this review is for all those haters out there complaining about \"originality\" and \"fan-service\".\n\nStory: (9/10 Great)\n\nNo Game No Life(hereafter referred to as NGNL) is a splendid anime about a pair of brilliant-minded brother and sister, who travel to a parallel universe where gaming is everything.\n\nBeing excellent gamers themselves, they proceed to conquer the world, one step at a time.\n\nNow, some of you may say at this point that the story doesn't seem all that new.\n\nMaybe so, but this hardly matters because of the smart games and plot twists that make the overall story very interesting and unique to behold.\n\nThere are times when everything seems lost, but our two protagonists will demonstrate a brilliant plan and eventually overcome any obstacle they face.\n\nThere will inevitably be someone saying \"But Kaiji...!\". Well, Kaiji is a great anime in its own rights, I'm not denying that.\n\nBut to combine so many different elements, such as ecchi fan-service, fantastical races and magic, as well as comedy into an anime so that they fit and work together so well is not something you see everyday.\n\nFurthermore, the entire story is tied in smoothly to an overall plot of conquering the world. Unlike other animes, such as Kaiji, that has been divided into no-so-smooth arcs.\n\nThe story is well-paced to give a balance of entertainment and progress in plot, and each episode will leave you wondering about what will happen next.\n\nAlso, the fan-service is just enough to keep the ecchi fans interested, and does not get in the way of the plot. (The ecchi is often part of the plot)\n\nLastly, I'd like to argue that anime need not be original in the first place. Unlike college application essays or scientific journals, anime solely exist to entertain people, and NGNL has proven itself to excel here.\n\nSo \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\",\n\nand haters, no more complaining about originality xD\n\nArt (10/10 Outstanding):\n\nVibrant, beautiful colors, as well as detailed background and beautiful characters have more than succeeded in seducing my eyes.\n\nWhat more can I say..\n\nJust by typing in NGNL in Google, you should be able to glimpse what I am talking about.\n\nThe animation is smooth, and the action scenes are quite cool.\n\nThe characters are well proportioned, and the girls look very gorgeous (and sometimes boobalicious).\n\nJibril is my personal favorite :D\n\nCharacters (7/10 Good):\n\nNothing too special here, tbh.\n\nThe characters have realistic thoughts and reactions, but there are some stereotypes at work here.\n\nThe two protagonists are as awesome as they should be, and even with their overpoweredness, gets the audience to sympathize with them and root for them throughout the series.\n\nJibril is somewhat weird, what with her majestic looks and ditzy personality. However that makes her quite funny and cute (?), at least for me it does xD\n\nSteph is stupid :P She was, is, and forever will be. Least favorite character, and perhaps she could've been made a little less silly.\n\nOverall though, the characters were quite good (especially the protagonists).\n\nSound (9/10 Great):\n\nNice OP and ED music, as well as theme music & soundtracks.\n\n\"This Game\" is one of my favorite anime music, but that might just be because I absolutely love piano music.\n\nAll of the music fit in well with the theme of the anime and with the specific scenes they are used in.\n\nThe sound effects are well done, nothing to complain about.\n\nEnjoyment (10/10 Outstanding):\n\nLoved it, love it, and I mean every moment of it.\n\nI really haven't enjoyed an anime this much since Code Geass.\n\nI would actually say that I enjoyed NGNL even more than Code Geass because I prefer the more laid-back and fun atmosphere of NGNL.\n\nEnjoyed the fan-service, the comedy, and so many other things (including Jibril).\n\nA definite 10 for me here!\n\nOverall (10/10 Outstanding)\n\nThere really is something for most people out there in this anime:\n\nYou like fanservice? NGNL's got it (appropriate amounts of it)\n\nYou like cool or OP MC? NGNL's got it\n\nYou like psychological/strategy stuff? NGNL's got it\n\nYou like colorful art? NGNL's got it\n\nYou like nice music? NGNL's got it\n\nWhisper: *You like lolis?* *NGNL's got it*\n\nIs there really a question? 10/10 for me!\n\nand may I just add that I don't understand the people rating this anime as a \"4\" or lower. According to MAL's grading scale, \"4\" is for \"bad\" anime. But haters gonna hate, too bad they're missing out ;)\n\nThank you for reading all of this!\n\nSigning out,\n\n\tjizzaloo\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n10\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by jizzaloo (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 6, 2015\n\nTheFlamingShark\n\nRecommended\n\n While I do hate to start this review off with a shameless plug, I do stress that my love for this anime can't simply be expressed in words, and if you have already seen No Game No Life, I highly recommend you to check out my reaction series of it on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLudLxRqlTVEjTHp4M96BuoORprQDt_9y5\n\nNow that my shameless plug is out of the way, I must express why I feel this is one of my favorite anime series.\n\nSTORY: 9/10\n\n(Contains spoilers of the first episode)\n\nNo Game No Life is an anime which focuses around two NEET's by the name of Shiro and Sora. These two are siblings and\n\n...\n\noften are arguably too close. They are infamous throughout the gaming community for being \"Blank\", a mysterious group of players who never lose regardless of any cheats used against them who gained that moniker because they never fill out a name for their characters. They found life to be a crappy game and sought refuge within the world of games to run away from that cruel existence. Of course, in typical anime style, their entire lives would change.\n\nAfter an anonymous email leads to a hard fought chess game won by Sora and Shiro, the two and sucked into the world of Disboard, a world in which all manner of conflict is determined through games.\n\nWhat would ensue throughout the series is Sora and Shiro's adventures as they try to basically conquer the fantasy world of Disboard. Elves, Warbeasts, Flugel, and many other fantasic creatures will be met along the way, and much fanservice is to be had as well. No Game No Life is quite the journey that few will ever forget.\n\nART: 8/10\n\nWhile I do find the art to be very beautiful, it isn't anything groundbreaking in anime and as such, I have little to say except it is very nice. \n\nSOUND: 9/10\n\nThe OST for No Game No Life is simply epic. The opening theme (This Game by Konomi Suzuki) is one of the best I have ever heard, and the ending theme is very strong as well (Oracion by Ai Kayano). The BGM is very underrated in my personal opinion, with themes such as \"All of You is All of Me\" and \"Reverse?\" (It's a freaking remix of Cornered 2001 from Gyakuten Saiban AKA Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. How in the world is it not going to be awesome?)\n\nCHARACTERS: 9/10\n\nThey are very well portrayed and developed, plain and simple. You would agree if you have seen the show. It does not focus solely on Shiro and Sora either, many other characters get legitimate development, which is somewhat surprising considering this show is twelve episodes long barring a season two at some point down the line.\n\nENJOYMENT: 10/10\n\nIf you don't enjoy this anime, we probably are nothing alike. This show has clever writing, a simple yet intricate story, wonderfully colorful and well developed characters, a great soundtrack, and even a bunch of fanservice for those who love that side of anime. No Game No Life is an experience I truly believe any anime fan casual or hardcore would enjoy immensely.\n\nOVERALL GRADE: 9/10\n\nIt isn't perfect, but it sure as heck is close.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheFlamingShark (\n1\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 25, 2014\n\nthedarkstalker\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Believe it or not, but NGNL is the hip thing of 2014. A lot of people liked it, similarly a lot of people disliked it, but all in all, they were all watching it and talking about it. I've recently been to MAL and learned that even after accountable negative criticism, the rating still stands at 8.76, which can be round-off to 9, which in MAL terms comes under \"Great\". Although this isn't the first case, and pretty likely, not the last, but let's use this as an example and try to think \"How?\" and \"Why?\"\n\nAs we can clearly make it out from the synopsis,\n\n...\n\nit's a series about people playing various games for resolving everyday issues, from trifling matters to the ones concerning national interest. Our two main protagonists gets sucked in to this world after they accept a challenge from an unknown person. Let's just say they are supposed to be the ultimate bad ass when it comes down to games, as a combo [Blank], they have the record and confidence to beat anyone at any game, hence their motto - \"Blank never lose\". Our protagonists have been introduced as NEETs, shut-ins and are suffering from communication disorder. Although I've seen anime based on \"gaming reality\" before - SAO, Accel World, etc., and I agree that parents/guardians in anime world can be a bit extreme (ex - opens door, the girl and boy are in awkward position, says best of luck to them and closes the door), but what kind of parents/guardians let their children remain totally cut-off from the world and be cooped up in their rooms, where they can play games day and night? This, along with other incidents, leads up to the apt image of the show as wish-fulfilling and an escapist's fantasy. It's true that most people turn towards entertainment to escape from daily lives, so watching characters do the same immediately forms a bridge between viewer and those characters. This becomes one of the biggest selling points of such series, which in business sense, is a good thing. But..\n\nBut the characterization is pretty much messed up. It's easy to see that both Sora and Shiro aren't the most sociable people around [Even while you are sociable enough on net, sitting behind a monitor, it's altogether different from when you are sitting face-to-face with someone]. Still, the way Sora communicates and reacts in the other world, quickly makes one question the character description they've been spoon-fed just minutes ago, more so, when that person supposed to have communication disorder. Writer must be smoking joint. Anyway, then you have a loli with striped panties - Shiro, who is insanely intelligent, however in a slightly different way than her aniki. Together they cover for each others weak spots and hence as a combo they are unbeatable. Now what does that tell you? The statement \"Blank never lose\" is pretty much a boner-killer, especially when the stakes are ridiculously high, it not only ensures the victory of our duo even before the actual game even starts, but also take away that \"doki-doki\" factor as in \"how will it turn out? what's going to happen? will they win?\". The tagline itself gives a major setback to the \"gaming\" theme.\n\nWell this isn't the only show which is home to many pop-culture tropes such as cat-ears, elfs, etc. So criticizing it just because of that doesn't seem the right thing to do. But what's the deal with these Japanese otaku fetishes? LOL. Since the series is heavily focused on otaku pleasure, setting wise it's only the right thing to do to ensure maximum profit, but what has happened to originality lately? The show is about characters getting sucked in another world, which although being one of the most generic settings, provides a lot of room to explore and experiment, to create some original character and world designs, to explore and push some creative boundaries. Take a look at Monogatari series, which also use many pop-culture tropes and even cliche' events, but still is able to pull off a refresh feel because of rich and uniquely explored characters and it's overall execution, it's impact-full. But NGNL was made to just earn money, we can't blame Madhouse for our disappointment, they are also suffering from declining market for innovative and intellectual stuff. \n\nEven side-characters are not a relief, they are just there to please the audience with fan-service and to help further the esteemed goals of our protagonists. What am I supposed to feel for them, \"Good boobs you got there\" maybe.\n\nThe show is about games but weighs heavily on random ass pulls to make our protagonists look like the ultimate bad ass winners. Ass pulls leads up to logical fallacies, which ultimately results in plot holes. For ex - \n\nJibril vs Blank game -\n\n[SPOILER]\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe rules say - \"if the thing is present there, it'll disappear and if it's not, then it'll appear\". Sora says \"Hydrogen Bomb\", which appears. Okay, now where does it say that it has to be a hydrogen bomb which is about to go off. Last time I checked, Hydrogen Bomb doesn't go off on their own.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n[/SPOILER]\n\nEven the infamous \"last fight\" in which Sora gets praised for his smartness, is nothing but the result of convenience in writing.\n\n[SPOILER]\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe level of assumption without actually knowing and analyzing the full extent of your opponent is not just dangerous but can be fatal. Even if Sora had assumed that Izuna has some kind of technique that pushes beyond the normal psychical boundaries, the extent of that can't be known precisely, even after being released, because one can't be sure of the extent up to which it can transcend. But somehow Sora and Shiro had it all figured out from the scribblings that Shiro did on the sand, without any proper explanation given, to the point of saying - \"Oh! I made it in time\". That's not intelligent thinking, that's convenient writing.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n[/SPOILER]\n\nThe show also make use of references to a lot of famous anime and gaming titles, as an addition to the comedy aspect. Needless to say this isn't anything original either, series like Gintama are pawning major titles with their sense of humor for a long time now. Even so, I believe the jokes in NGNL are pretty good, if there's anything good in the series, then this is clearly it. I followed this series weekly, so it served as a time-pass and mood changer from the TV series I was into that time.\n\nArt & Animation wise, the show did a fine job. It was colorful and vibrant, pretty good for lightening up the mood after watching something serious/depressing. Music wasn't memorable enough, in fact I can't even recall a single soundtrack. So no points there.\n\nThe sense and meaning of \"entertainment\" can vary from person to person. Some people just look for and enjoy a good time-pass, some have their fetishes to deal with, some look for creativity and originality and some look for a certain smartness. A fair warning though, it can be irritating at times, especially if you are the type that seeks and enjoy a certain intellectual depth in any art or literature form. It is as good as the majority of anime out there. So do I recommend this anime? Personally NO, since I didn't find it good enough for anyone to purposely use their bandwidth and time over it. But, at the same time, if you have read the whole review and are fine with whatever is written, be my guest and watch the show.\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n4\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by thedarkstalker (\n4\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 9, 2014\n\nCosmicblaze454\n\nRecommended\n\n No Game No Life is one of the most hyped animes of spring 2014.\n\nSo let's start the review.\n\nStory:\n\nI love NGNL's concept. Siblings transferred to another world where everything was settled with games. But the twist is here is that they don't want to go back.\n\n Blank are considered as a Mary Sue, which means there victory is assured and how they win is the story all about. The good thing here is that how they win is a mystery and that is why many people liked it. Sora pulled a Deus ex Machima in epsiode 4.(i think) The pacing is good. But the story is\n\n...\n\nfull of fanservices in almost every episode which destroys the story itself. The jokes sucks too.\n\nBut I'm gonna give the story 8.\n\nArt:\n\nMadhouse did a pretty good job. I love the color palette. Every scene was colorful. Animation is good. The colors were vibrant and fits the show. I am gonna give the art a 10.\n\nSound:\n\nOP is amazing. It shows what NGNL is. It makes you excited.\n\nThe ED is more of a soft song that gives you feels.\n\nNuff said. 10\n\nCharacter:\n\nBlank:\n\nBlank are absolute Mary Sues. They are one dimensional characters.\n\nSora is just pervert but a genius player. He can be a little silly but when it comes to games he gets serious. Shiro is a smart girl who is basically smarter than Sora but aside from that she is your typical imouto loli.\n\nOther characters are only fanservice fodders. They became like that when they lose to Blank. The characters are mediocre at best. 6\n\nEnjoyment:\n\nEven with NGNL's flaws its enjoyment made many people like it. The clever tricks made by Blank was enjoyed by many people. If you are a gamer the more you will enjoy and like this anime. 10\n\nOverall:\n\nIt was enjoyable had a amazing story but it was brought down by some unremarkable negative aspects. 7\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Cosmicblaze454 (\n26\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nAug 31, 2015\n\nEnergyPants\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Preface: I'm sorry if I sound angry or mad in this response because I have talked about this show many times, and my hate goes FAR beyond me just thinking this is a bad show lol\n\nFirst, let me start off on why I think it's bad. \n\nStory: 1/10\n\nThe story contains more plot holes than I can count on my fingers and toes (EX. If Sora and Shiro had the previous king basically write them an instruction manual on the shooter game they played against the animal people, why did they freak out when they realized they were in the city? Surely the manual mentioned that.\n\n...\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the cheating. Cheating is one of the only rules established, and yet everyone does it to the point where it's not even a game of skill or wit, but a competition to see who can cheat better. AND NO ONE EVER GETS CAUGHT) The games themselves are entertaining for the first 5 minutes, until we are bombarded with table turns. One minute, Sora and Shiro have a commanding lead, then the next they are helpless only to repeat this cycle man times throughout the entirety of the games. This wouldn't be as bad, however, if the main protagonists could lose, BUT THEY CAN'T. They literally say countless times throughout the show \"Blank never loses.\" I don't know about you, but I lost all interest after the constant repetition of \"Blank never loses.\" Oh, they're losing this chess game? Good thing \"Blank never loses.\" What's this? The opponent is cheating AGAIN (and surprisingly no one notices) WHAT'S COULD POSSIBLY HAP... Oh wait I almost forgot. \"Blank never loses.\" The games fell flat and became incredibly uninteresting because of this. It's also a fudging ecchi (and ecchi is my least favorite genre.) Need I say more on that? xD Lastly this show ends with a terrible \"read the light novel ending.\" When I got to the last episode, I found myself 100% DISsatisfied, and that in and of itself was enough to make me not like the show from the get-go. (It's my least favorite ending of ALL TIME) I would have loved to have heard or have seen more than 2 races, but I guess I'll have to read the light novel to do so (Spoilers: I'm not going to) \n\nCharacters: 1/10\n\nThe characters are abysmal. Sora and Shiro have one driving factor, and that is to be kings of this world. Anything more? Any backstory? How did they meet? Why are they so good at games? Why doesn't Shiro wear a longer skirt, so there aren't as many pantyshots? (She's 11 btw) The show neglects to tell us all these things (especially the last one,) and the main characters are incredibly empty because of it. What about Jibril? Nothing to say there either. Same with that one elf girl and her former slave who's names escape me FOR SOME REASON (It's because they are irrelevant.) No backstory, no real driving factors, no development. Just plain, 2D cardboard cutouts. Notice I've saved the best for last. Steph. Steph is the worst character I've seen in anime to date. She is nothing but a fanservice device, she is the intermediary character who goes from smart to dumb just for the sake of relaying Sora and Shiro's thought processes to the audience (not like it matters considering Blank never loses) and has no backstory or development to speak of. All the characters are completely worthless to the point of not being able to call them characters.\n\nArt: 7/10\n\nI will give credit where it's due, the art is really good. Great use of red outlines, but just a tad bit too bright for my liking. The game world looked great, and backgrounds were really well done.\n\nSound: 6/10\n\nThe sound was good, as well with a fantastic opening, and great VA's\n\nSo that's why I think it's a bad show, but why do I hate this show so much?\n\nEnjoyment: .05/10\n\nBet you didn't think it went lower than a 1, did you? Well, I had to make an exception in this case. There is one reason besides everything mentioned above) why I dislike the show so much, and why it's my least favorite show of all time It's the fanbase. The people who have told me this utterly terrible show is good. Now, if you like the show, that's 100% fine. I can't argue with your opinions, and I think NO LESS of anyone who likes this show. But it's the countless arguments I've had with people who try to tell me this show is actually good. As you can see, I can back up my reasoning on why I think this show is bad because I've had to do this exact same thing many, MANY times. I've typed LOTS of paragraphs to people, and sometimes with a negative and condescending intent because I've been told by one of these people AND I QUOTE EXACTLY \"I am not going to lie I won't lie I am going to say this right now you are worthless please kill yourself this anime is in so many ways...\" (keep in mind I said nothing to this person prior to this comment on my review on my Youtube channel)\n\nIf I were to average my scores, it would be a 3.1 but this show doesn't deserve that.\n\nSo that's it. Sorry I ranted, and I mean no ill intent nor do I mean to be condescending to anyone in any way by anything I've said. And let me finish by saying again, I have no problems with anyone liking this show. Your opinion is just that, and I can't (and won't) hate you for thinking the way you do. I'm just plain hate it when people are condescending about me not liking it as much as I do, or try to tell me it's a good show xD\n\n Reviewer’s Rating: \n1\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by EnergyPants (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJul 30, 2014\n\nMnemofysh\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n “I’m sure you know what this means.” - Jibril, Episode 6.\n\nMe: Actually, I have no idea. \n\nI know that the unimaginable hype surrounding this anime has long since passed its prime, but let's just ignore that.\n\nFrom what I've seen so far, everyone either hates or adores this anime. In fact, so much that it's almost black and white. I found that, as a whole, it is neither as bad. Or as good as most people make it out to be. It had its fair share of flaws, and wasn't something that left me sitting at my computer in amazement, but I will say that it\n\n...\n\nis enjoyable and a decent anime.\n\nThe plot of NGNL is a plot that we've all seen countless times in the past, yet the makers of the anime were still able to squeeze in a touch of originality, such as violence is forbidden (as opposed to being encouraged in similar situations in other anime), and that everything is decided by games. That even, upon further thought, leads me to wonder whether it even is a game world, since no one in there apart from our main protagonists have the slightest clue that our own world exists. Also, the two MCs are glad to be in this world.\n\nApart from this, there was frankly nothing worth mentioning in terms of plot. Sure, now and then there were some plot twists (a partly accurate term) and cliffhangers, but other than that, there was no particularly evident plot line. Most of the aforementioned twists came seemingly out of nowhere and ended just as suddenly with a sudden burst of epiphany from the part of either Shiro or Sora. Most of them had no further consequences or effects on the story line.\n\nFurthermore, it was another one of those annoying cases that despite being rushed, it was incredibly slow-paced.\n\nMy poor soul also didn’t realise that it was an Ecchi until it was too late. I would expand more on it, but let it suffice to say that it did nothing for the plot line. Coupled with this was a sense of forced and exaggerated comedy element, full of exaggerations (such as characters bashing the walls with their heads), somewhat sexual and shallow jokes. Dialogue goes hand in hand with this - for instance how Sora is constantly obsessed with underwear, or how he promises the soldier chess pieces the right to ‘bang’ any woman that they want. \n\nOverall, I give it a 6/10, because despite it’s flaws, it’s safe to say that I found it interesting and watched a number of episodes in a row.\n\nThe art is possibly the weirdest that I have seen. Whilst it’s not actually that bad, the colours are way to vivid and weird. \n\nThe main thing I didn’t like about the art was that often, physical traits were much too accentuated, such as Shiro’s numerous huge ahoges as well as cat-shaped mouth and the bags under Sora’s eyes. Also, when it came to other characters, the shape and size of their breasts was often very evident - not to mention that their outfits were often very revealing. \n\nStill, I guess it is commendable that the art style is fresh and new - it’s unlike anything I’ve seen before. Just saying that perhaps some must have to be careful. 6.5/10. \n\nMusic was possibly one of my favourite aspects of the show. Some of the themes were quite… epic (in terms of genre, I mean) and totally befitting of the show. Whilst they weren’t my favourites, I really liked the OP and ED of it.\n\nVoice acting is another story. In order to suit the characters perhaps, the voices were not all that pleasant - for instance Shiro’s was almost always monotonous and soft. Sometimes, different character’s voices sounded so similar I questioned whether or not it was the same person voicing them. To summarise, it was as if they were trying to use the voices for the character’s personality to come across better. \n\nI would give it an 8, if not for the voices. As such, it stands at 7.5/10. \n\nAnd, onto the element that I disliked the most of this show… characters. \n\nThe characters essentially brought down the entire show. They might have been a little interesting if not for the fact that they are entirely unrealistic (in terms of personality) and that I’ve seen them so many times before. We’ve got the usual girl-oriented gamer brother (Sora), along with the genius, not-understanding-human-interactions kuudere little sister (Shiro) - the two of them make up the very stereotypical NEETs who stay at home all day and are scared of the sunlight, outside world and being more than 10 metres apart from each other - the typical idiotic fan service character (Steph) and Jibril. I’m not entirely sure what category she would fall into (perhaps the bookworm), but let me assure you that her character was not fresh. \n\nI will admit that the character’s little quirks did provide for a little entertainment, but they were just much too stale. I give ‘character’s a 4/10.\n\nAs a whole, this anime was okay. I wouldn’t really watch it again (or recommend it to my friends), some scenes made me feel plain awkward, some of it was ridiculous, some of it was funny and some of it was interesting. In the end, it would be wrong to say that I disliked it. In fact, I liked it more than I thought I would.\n\nI might just add that this is an anime that shows that you must not judge by first episodes. If it had kept up the same standard as the first episode all the way through, it would have been a 4 or a 5. However, it comes to:\n\nStory: 6/10\n\nArt: 7/10\n\nSound: 7.5/10\n\nCharacters: 4/10\n\nEnjoyment: 7/10\n\nOverall: 6.3/10 (rounded to a 6)\n\nSuch a score means that whilst it was a little below average, it was still enjoyable. Just don’t start watching it with huge expectations.\n\nOne more note: This review was really hard to write. I would expect that it would be below the norm of my other ones.

Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\nEdit\nBackground\nBlue Lock\n was released on Blu-ray and DVD in four volumes from January 27, 2023, to July 28, 2023.\n\nEdit\nRelated Entries\n\n Sequel\n (TV)\n\n Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan\n\n Adaptation\n (Novel)\n\n Shousetsu Blue Lock\n\n Adaptation\n (Manga)\n\n Blue Lock\n\nRead Manga\n\n Spin-Off:\n\nBlue Lock: Episode Nagi\n (Movie)\n\n Other:\n\nBlue Lock Additional Time\n (ONA)\n\nMore related entries\n\nVisit MALxJapan\n\nMALxJapan -More than just anime-\n\nWin 3,000 USD for your story ‚úçÔ∏è\n\nYour guide to 2025's Must-Read Manga is here üìñ\n\nAward-winning sommelier drama, sweaty romances and sci-fi classics‚Äîhere are Kodansha's top picks üìö\n\nMore characters\nCharacters & Voice Actors\n\nBachira, Meguru\n\nMain\n\nKaito, Tasuku\n\nJapanese\n\nIsagi, Yoichi\n\nMain\n\nUra, Kazuki\n\nJapanese\n\nChigiri, Hyouma\n\nMain\n\nSaitou, Souma\n\nJapanese\n\nKunigami, Rensuke\n\nMain\n\nOno, Yuuki\n\nJapanese\n\nNagi, Seishirou\n\nSupporting\n\nShimazaki, Nobunaga\n\nJapanese\n\nItoshi, Rin\n\nSupporting\n\nUchiyama, Kouki\n\nJapanese\n\nBarou, Shouei\n\nSupporting\n\nSuwabe, Junichi\n\nJapanese\n\nShidou, Ryuusei\n\nSupporting\n\nNakamura, Yuuichi\n\nJapanese\n\nMikage, Reo\n\nSupporting\n\nUchida, Yuuma\n\nJapanese\n\nItoshi, Sae\n\nSupporting\n\nSakurai, Takahiro\n\nJapanese\n\nMore staff\n\nStaff\n\nFurukawa, Shin\n\nProducer\n\nArisawa, Ryouya\n\nProducer\n\nMori, Yuuki\n\nProducer\n\nHirano, Tsutomu\n\nProducer\n\nEdit\n\nOpening Theme\n\n\"Chaos ga Kiwamaru („Ç´„Ç™„Çπ„ÅåÊ•µ„Åæ„Çã)\"\n by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN\n\n(eps 2-13)\n\n\"Judgement\"\n by ASH DA HERO\n\n(eps 14-22,24)\n\nEdit\n\nEnding Theme\n\n1:\n \"Chaos ga Kiwamaru („Ç´„Ç™„Çπ„ÅåÊ•µ„Åæ„Çã)\"\n by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN\n\n(eps 1,24)\n\n2:\n \"WINNER\"\n by Shuugo Nakamura\n\n(eps 2-12)\n\n3:\n \"Judgement\"\n by ASH DA HERO\n\n(eps 13)\n\n4:\n \"Numbness like a ginger\"\n by UNISON SQUARE GARDEN\n\n(eps 15-23)\n\nMore Videos\nEpisode Videos\n\n Episode 24\n\n Episode 23\n\n Episode 22\n\n Episode 21\n\nReviews\n\n Write review\n\n131\n\n Recommended\n\n53\n\n Mixed Feelings\n\n38\n\n Not Recommended\n\n All reviews (\n222\n)\n\nApr 8, 2025\n\nangecritter\n\nRecommended\n\n An intense, stylish, but often times overambitious sports anime with a hefty dose of shounen absurdity.\n\nIntro\n\nBlue Lock portrays soccer as an ego-driven death game wrapped in capitalism and shounen melodrama. It's intense, absurd, and a little bit horny. And honestly, that's what makes it so damn entertaining - but it's not without its issues.\n\nStorytelling/Pacing\n\nThe series spans a standard 24 episodes, which should be enough to tell a tightly paced story. However, the show gets heavily bogged down by its own shounen tropes and poor pacing. The series builds tension well, but too often these moments are buried under bloated internal monologues - especially from Isagi.\n\n...\n\nWhile the psychological aspect is cool at first, the constant ego rants lose impact fast. Isagi's internal monologues are far too often less character exploration and more faux intellectual drivel, and it kills the pacing. Hard. He doesn't develop so much as absorb philosophies like he's a twinky sponge. The matches, as interesting as they are visually, often fall into the realm of Filler Lane, where the characters have to go through an uphill battle in their own minds each time. This is redundant. Either make it more sparse or have different things happen.\n\nThere's an undeniable sense that the show is getting high on its own excess. But when everything is life-or-death... nothing is. It numbs you. High drama becomes background noise. After a while, watching Blue Lock is like listening to Merzbow on top of Kendrick Lamar. It's brilliance beneath a layer of pure exhaustion.\n\nVisuals\n\nThat said, when Blue Lock does fire on all cylinders, it's absolutely brilliant. The animation is top fucking tier in both technical and artistic quality - brimming with passion in every frame, every major character design full of thematic cohesion. The character designs are always so damn sharp, exaggerated, and full of personality. I'll concede that for some of the supporting cast, they fall into the realm of generic anime high schoolers, but it's not a dealbreaker. I would've preferred it to be more of a spectacle, even with less focus on side characters, but for the main cast? Oh yeah, they nailed it. Bachira has that childlike wonder in his eyes and even his hair, Isagi is determined yet youthful, Rin is...okay, Rin is basically just a taller version of Isagi, just with 20% more cynicism. The way the supernatural/psychedelic elements are shown is really great, too - it really utilizes the medium to its advantage by showing a metaphor for how locked in these guys are on the field, even if the ego monsters are a bit jarring. Despite the sensory overload this show is so fond of, the direction knows how to land emotional beats when it matters most. They take this shit so seriously that it can feel like people are dying out here, even when it's \"just\" a soccer game. But since we're talking about animation: why use 3D models for distant characters? It just pulls me out of the scene when there's a clear difference in art styles, even if it's just for select scenes. They look like scrapped PS2 models - cheap and stiff, kinda like the music.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nMusic in Blue Lock is a mixed bag for me. I love the first OP, like the rest of the OPs and EDs, and don't care much for the background music. The OPs really sell that aggressive, youthful conquest for victory - I can feel Bachira's indulgent yet disciplined passion in every note, and the EDs are cute and sentimental. BGM in this series feels like generic electronic-style sports music, it doesn't do anything particularly interesting to hype scenes up and its composition is...fine. I would've been okay with generic music if it fit the tone (sports can be kind of stale) but Blue Lock is anything BUT generic. Why not go all-out with tunes that catch you off guard? The BGM tries to be energetic but lands somewhere between Skrillex impersonator and the soundtrack to a Fortnite crypto scam. I would've loved to see some Masafumi Takada-esque EDM bangers a la Danganronpa V3 to soundtrack the wild action that occurs, or hell, even some banging cyber metal. There was a lot of room to experiment here, but the chance was simply not taken.\n\nThemes\n\nBlue Lock actually has something to say. It's not just about soccer: it's about ego, ambition, and what it means to pursue greatness with complete disregard for teamwork or tradition. It's a sports anime with the plot of a shounen death game, without the death but with all the philosophical dread. I'm not sold on the philosophy it's going for, but what matters most is its believability. These are soccer players with the drive to be the best at any cost - and I can completely see how they come to their primarily self-fulfilling conclusions. It definitely doesn't shy away from showing other perspectives too. Isagi gets treated like a self-serving dick more as the series progresses, and I found it pretty funny how they call out him trying to be the main character of the story. It's no labyrinthine debate, but I'm glad the showrunners are at least a little self-aware. Blue Lock has something to say, but what adds layers is that it never really gives you a straight moral to take. Personally, I see Isagi as a well-meaning occasional bonehead whose ego may eventually eat him alive, but you might see him as a complete asshole that has no regard for his friends. These are conversations that are worth having, and as a sucker for philosophy, I definitely want to talk to some people about how they view the characterization at play here. Despite its interesting themes, however, it can be a little too unsubtle in its delivery at times. I don't need everything to be super nuanced and intricate, but I feel that a lot of the time, Blue Lock kicks back on having clear-cut motivations for everyone that leave little room for intrigue. The show would've done this better if it took more time to build specific perspectives instead of it being primarily an ensemble cast, especially when a few characters rely way too heavily on tropes. (looking at you, Tokimitsu)\n\nTone\n\nTonally, Blue Lock lives in this really odd space between hardcore serious sports shounen and off-the-wall comedy. It's not a perfect contrast by any means, but I'd say that its flaws add more merit and memorability to it, which is an absolute win in my book. Are some of the voice actors going way too hard? Absolutely. But I'd much rather have that than phoned-in performances with nothing interesting going on.\n\nMy Strange Addiction\n\nOkay, let me just break character for a second, because I need to talk about my one true love, Meguru Bachira. This man quickly became my husbando as the series progressed. He's so cute, I love how driven he is, how much romantic tension there is between him and the rest of the cast, and just the sheer passion he has for soccer above LITERALLY anything else. He's the perfect protagonist, and I didn't even realize he was a protagonist until he'd already stolen my heart. I love how he perfectly captures the themes of ego and ambition by being the centerpiece - driven by pure love and passion for everyone on the team via the realm of soccer. Everything about the way he thinks and plays is this perfect harmony of his worldview tying into every action he takes. It's gorgeous. Beyond all the analysis though, my emotional reaction to him is so strong that I just NEED to get this out. What an amazing little creature.\n\nOutro\n\nBlue Lock is so far from perfection it may as well be allergic to it - but it's got style, guts, and a few standout moments that make the ride worth it. Just don't expect a masterpiece. Expect an over-the-top shounen about egos and highly queer existential crises.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n7\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by angecritter (\n6\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nApr 17, 2025\n\nbergars\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n It's fun to see a show admit you have to be an egotistical bastard at times. \n\nI'm tired of battle royale's, man. I've seen the tropes. How characters unite in the most unlikely ways. The empathetic main character, or the morality at play when put against people who could be good. Rarely done with nuance, and I'll admit, this one gets pretty close to being great, but I really couldn't take it seriously. \n\nBattle Royale, but with soccer. You got monsters who can level the playfield, you've got the underdogs, the great prospects, and our protagonist who is very much a nobody in a sea\n\n...\n\nof potential nobodies. He's gotta climb his way through, alright, sure, fine. I went along with it, and took what was essentially 24 episodes of what I can only describe as an author holding back. \n\nBe it the slow progression, the character dialogue, and the constant weirdness in all of them. First, you can tell the big cast of characters merits diverse personalities. It allows them to stand out, to have their voice, but as a problem, they're too out there, exaggerated, stupid, incoherent. Their way of thinking makes sense for each character, but they get so repetitive. \n\nThey repeat their way of talking every time they're on-screen, just for those three seconds to remind us of their existence. It speaks poorly of the writer's ability to direct them without being edgy, or plain cringe. Stuff like ‚ÄúI have a demon in my heart‚Äù. These are highschoolers, close to 18-years-old. If they were middle schoolers, that's the limit, but please, STFU. \n\nSecond. This is an experiment from the author, and you can tell. I've read the author's biggest works before this one, and while still childishly dealing with adult themes, the writing stood out, the characters were given proper depth, since they couldn't cross the line of excess. There were always smaller casts, and thing is, the next season, or part of the story probably works way better since the story rids itself of unneeded characters. However, the most edgy ones stay, and weirder ones just got in, making my optimism utterly stupid. \n\nI wish there was more to chew on, more of an interesting main character. Even if his dynamic is very fresh, being able to predict the playing field, and what not, his personality is as plain as you can imagine. Main character, underdog, nice guy, the least unusual, with a strange awakened state. I'm tired of it, and this simply perpetuates clich√©'s without being able to break away from them. \n\nThe animation works, the story works, and it moves, but I'll give it a chance to redeem itself. It's not bad, it's just on the verge of being bad. It can only get better if the author manages to truly use its cast, and lesson, to change the protagonist and the people around him. Other than that, it just doesn't stand out that much compared to the author's other works, which have a little more to say about its world than this. \n\n6/10. If the author was trying to make a typical Shonen, you can feel the Victorian style skeleton whispering he should go back to his edgy roots.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by bergars (\n180\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMar 25, 2025\n\nYunice\n\nNot Recommended\n\n Frankly speaking, I do not know what the hype is all about for this anime series. There is not much going on other than a bunch of frenzied \"strikers\" throughout the whole show trying to outdo one another. Actual matches with normal players are pretty much non-existent.\n\nNext, I need to talk about the art. The eyes! Why? Why do the characters look like they are in a permanent state of shock the whole time? Also, some of those eyes gave me the heebie-jeebies more than most horror shows did. I hated how they creeped me out while watching, and it was really a major distraction.\n\nThere\n\n...\n\nis also so much internal monologue! If there isn't so much of that, I am quite sure the whole series could have been done within a twelve-episode run. It has been exhausting having to sit through a few minutes of internal monologue before almost every tiny bit of kick or pass in a sports show.\n\nThe only dramatic thing in this show is the unnecessary drama within the brains of the characters every time they see, or want to do something.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n3\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Yunice (\n16\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMore stacks\nInterest Stacks\n\nAutistic characters\n\nby\n\ngakuendo\n\n32 Entries · 75 Restacks\n\nüéßAnime with Thai dubsüáπüá≠5ÔΩúüéß‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏¢‡πå‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢üáπüá≠‡πï\n\nby\n\nAdrena\n\n50 Entries · 2 Restacks\n\nEsportes DUB PT-BR\n\nby\n\ntrephacard\n\n22 Entries · 1 Restacks\n\nMore recommendations\n\nRecommendations\n\nAo Ashi\n26 Users\nHaikyuu!!\n10 Users\nKuroko no Basket\n8 Users\nOne Outs\n3 Users\nGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor\n2 Users\nCaptain Tsubasa (2018)\n2 Users\nInazuma Eleven\n2 Users\nTomodachi Game\n1 User\nKuroko no Basket 3rd Season\n1 User\nKami no Tou\n1 User\nDiamond no Ace\n1 User\nDays\n1 User\nDeath Note\n1 User\nDanganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation\n1 User\nMedalist\n1 User\nBaby Steps\n1 User\nShokugeki no Souma\n1 User\nAll Out!!\n1 User\nBoku no Hero Academia\n1 User\nTokyo Revengers: Tenjiku-hen\nAutoRec\nBleach: Sennen Kessen-hen - Ketsubetsu-tan\nAutoRec\nEiyuuou, Bu wo Kiwameru Tame Tenseisu: Soshite, Sekai Saikyou no Minarai Kishi‚ôÄ\nAutoRec\nKinsou no Vermeil: Gakeppuchi Majutsushi wa Saikyou no Yakusai to Mahou Sekai wo Tsukisusumu\nAutoRec\nTomo-chan wa Onnanoko!\nAutoRec\nMore news\nRecent News\nIn Pursuit of Egoism: The Essence of 'Blue Lock'\n\n Blue Lock has quickly become a standout in the sports anime genre, known for its intense action and psychological depth as it redefines the high-stakes world of soc...\nread more\n\nOct 24, 2024 10:33 PM by \nKineta\n | \nDiscuss (6 comments)\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for May\n\nHere are the North American anime, manga, and light novel releases for May.

While Ao Ashi is more grounded and Blue Lock is more exaggerated fantasy, if you're watching one you likely enjoy shonen anime, sports anime and football/soccer. So you will likely get at least some enjoyment out of the other series too. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nJVskunkape\n\nBoth have a football theme, but for Blue Lock we are shown the ambition of a striker who is faced with obstacles and difficult training between fellow strikers from all over the country, for Aoashi we are shown the fate of a striker who is required to be in the wing back position in order to become the perfect striker. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nbnyot\n\na good anime that is centered around football and some special players \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nFargonM\n\nVision. Each MC has extraordinary vision and foresight of the field. The way these authors showcase the application of vision in offense and defense creates a really cool comparison. One focuses on how vision can grow the team, while the other shows how foresight can pave the path for the individual.  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nDreddful\n\nBoth anime are based on soccer but focus on different topics. Blue Lock is more action packed but Ao Ashi is more realistic. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nKurdillua\n\nthese both are soccer/futball anime where the mc tries to be the best at what they do while they learn to better themselves in the process \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nicytripple\n\nBoth series have protagonists who have faced circumstances that motivated them to join a sports camp/organization on their journey to become the best players. They meet new players in which many of them have their background stories. These animes portray the essence of holistic teamwork as well as individual competitiveness.  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nkageyama_shigeo\n\nBoth are top tier soccer anime. Both focus on an MC trying to find what makes him unique on the soccer field to put him above the rest to continue advancing in the Japanese soccer tiers.  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nWillpxwer\n\nwhile both have football as a common theme, ao ashi is more realistic and targets the seinen audience. BL is shounen on the other hand. As a seinen fan BL was a tad bit cringe for me in the earlier episodes but as Isagi progresses it fills you up with adrenaline the same way when you watch an actual football match. Seemingly shallow, BL surprises you with deep takes on psychology at times. In a way a feel good anime for sadistic people. But the similarity bw the 2 anime is that both of them make YOU feel more interested in football as a sport. \n\nread more\n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nKamuithepirate\n\nBoth are related to football. There is different storyline in both but you will enjoy Blue Lock if you liked Ao Ashi \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \naomine53\n\nBoth Blue Lock and Ao Ashi revolve around soccer and focus on the growth of young players aspiring to become the best in the sport. They highlight intense training, rivalries, and the challenges of overcoming personal and team weaknesses. While Ao Ashi emphasizes teamwork and tactical growth, Blue Lock dives into the psychological battle of individuality and ego. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nRikxar\n\nProtagonist with:\r\n- high football IQ -- check\r\n- excellent spatial awareness -- check\r\n\nit's really interesting how contradicting the way both MCs in 'using' their teammates. And yet, still giving the same fulfilling drama.\r\n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \ndeesintegrashun\n\nTwo of the most hyped soccer animes in recent years. They feature interesting protagonists that throughout their anime become great players. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nvaderps\n\n- Both football animes\r\n- Competitive rivalries between the MC and other characters\r\n- Hardworking and determined MCs who both have similar talents \r\n\nI do have to warn you, their ideals are the exact opposite of each other, one about teamwork (Ao Ashi), while the other is about selfishness and individuality (BLLK)\r\n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nYuikoKira\n\nIf u like football with team work and other players and sports men spirits then Ao Ashi is best  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nmugenn__\n\nI'm going to start off by saying the obvious. They're both football/soccer sport animes! Both of them are very very good. Blue Lock without a doubt tops Ao Ashi however. The artwork and animation are exceedingly more stunning and interesting to look at, the action of it all immerses you. Whereas with Ao Ashi there is far more downtime with the training arc bits and personal problems, there's even a hint of romance in there. Both animes have this supernatural feel to them, like Kuroko's Basketball if you have seen that. Comparing them both together is difficult to do but I can say this with \ncertainty. Even if you hate soccer/football with every fibre of your being (just like me), you will still enjoy these two a lot.\n\nread more\n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nbridishbirb\n\nThey're both about someone who loves being a forward in soccer, but is at first held back by the team their in. Both main characters find their own way of becoming the best forward they can be all while facing obstacles on the way to the top. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nBobTheBuilderOof\n\nboth pretty much accurate football anime and their main characters also show development stages from the start, it is really worth to binge \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nRizzNoKami\n\nTwo of the best soccer anime imo. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nTheRBK\n\nwhen it comes to sports anime, it is the most realistic production in the topic of football, which shows how in this genre it is far from ideal, it is boring at the beginning, but then it becomes more interesting 8/10 also emotional anime about football \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nNoLongerAtsushi\n\nThe Best Sports/ Football Animes \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nMelsonNoronha\n\nwell both of them are related to \"Football\" ahh that's it I don't wanna give some kinda spoiler just enjoy this master pieces.  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \ndanimenerd\n\nTwo of the best football anime.\r\nBlue Lock is more action packed with sick moments, while Ao Ashi is more realistic/tactical. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nAmroun\n\nSame football anime but realistic. Blue lock is from team work to ego while Ao Ashi is from ego to team work \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nladderboi123\n\nBoth are soccer animes with Ashito Ali, the best player on his struggling team with an unpredictable playing style centered around himself. He learns how to play for the team and use his skills to the fullest extent. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \ntenwoe1\n\nHaikyuu!!\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nBlue Lock and Haikyuu are two fantastic anime series that lovers of volleyball and soccer in general will enjoy. They are, nevertheless, quite different in many ways, including tone, setting, objective, connection, and message. These distinctions distinguish them and make them interesting in their own right. Despite the fact that the games are distinct, the protagonist's purpose appears to be comparable. Be the greatest by defeating your opponents!  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nIAmGrace\n\nRead recommendations by \n9\n more users\n\nBoth of these are 2 of my fav sports anime and are polar opposites of one another in terms of how it explores its characters, however the storytelling of both is on par with one another and is really fun to binge  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nTheOmaster22\n\nYo, I'm surprised no one has recommended Haikyuu yet? In terms of intensity, these two are basically at par. There's tension, rivalry, and constant evolution, both in skills and perspective of their sport. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \ntake0kun\n\nBoth animes have school friendship and development of tactical skills in players \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nan_ayush\n\nIf you're looking for an anime like haikyuu but with black air force energy, battle royale theme and having the sole purpose of destroying your teammates rather than working together then here is blue lock \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nJuisei\n\nBoth of the series are similar in terms of sports and in both series they are trying to get to the top.\r\nWhile Blue Lock is a bit serious and strange, \r\nHaikyuu is more chill and funny\r\nBoth are quite competitive. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nAngie_Everlee\n\nI found out about this anime because of that one edit on Tiktok. The U20 match edit, yes. I believe you would like this if you liked Haikyuu. Similar to Haikyuu, each character is explored, their backstory is revealed, and you can watch how they develop over the course of the show. What makes it different from Haikyuu is that there can only be one victor, which makes it difficult for them to work together. In Haikyuu, the teams do their best to support one another so that nobody is left behind. While in Blue Lock, you have to learn to improve on your own, \nor you'll be left behind.\n\nread more\n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nkunigamisgf\n\nBoth haikyuu and blue lock are sports anime with teenage boys as the main characters.\r\nBoth protagonists have some extraordinary abilities setting them apart from other people in the same sport, while being weak in other areas required.\r\nBoth anime have a somewhat similar plot: the main character loses a match, but is selected into a place with strong players.\r\nBoth anime are popular shounen \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nOtakodo_kumo\n\nIf you liked teamwork and development to achieve a goal, how about competitiveness and selfishness to grow and achieve your goal? Completely opposite poles, different points of perspective. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nNanakuzu\n\nThis is self-explanatory; both are sports anime and have good plots. But watch Blue Lock first and then Haikyuu because it's like watching gold then turning into diamond. Haikyuu is really good because the creator doesn't always glaze the main characters like other animes. It shows the development of the main characters and showing how they beat the people better than them. But sometimes its just annoying how the creator makes Karasuno and the opposing team have points back to back making the episode longer. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \necob\n\nKuroko no Basket\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nBoth anime about a team sport.\r\nBoth anime about the team of sports egoists.\r\nAll the main characters have unique abilities.\r\nThe main character has no special physical force, but he has an unusual talent. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nDollParanoid\n\nRead recommendations by \n7\n more users\n\nIf you enjoyed the unique powers and characters, impactful and exciting animation, and especially the second half of he series’ smaller team battles then you’ll probably love KnB. Kuroko no Basuke is huffing from the same paint can as Blue Lock and I’d argue it does everything Blue Lock does better. If Blue Lock gave you a rush you’ll be jumping out of your seat at certain points in KnB. Give it a shot, you won’t be disappointed! \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nLillebo77\n\nBlue lock is very similar to Kuroko. Blue lock is just creating 1 GOM but better. As Kuroko progresses it leans towards \"friendship is power\" trope while blue lock is individuals getting better(becoming GOM's). They both demonstrate their moves like some super power but it looks super freakin good. They both are just super fun to watch. if u like GOM then you'll enjoy Blue lock (vice-versa).  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nCJustawaye\n\nteam sports anime with super power-like elements, main characters have their own unique skills, and both use color to show when players are in a flow state \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nfatnat1234\n\nI know, it is not the same sport.\r\n\nKuroko no basket can be old, but the levels of hype are equivalent to the blue lock ones.\r\nIt is close. With better development of characters Kuroko no Basket ends up being BETTER than Blue Lock for me.\r\n\nHighly recommend. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nHaruPoth\n\nBoth are sports animes & their rival characters are incredibly powerful. If you watched Blue Lock with excitement and enjoyed it, then you'll 100% enjoy Kuroko no Basket as well. (vice-versa) \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nmisaxg\n\nBoth anime show the protagonist as an inteligent player, value the strategies they use during the game and show how this alternative ways to winning are stronger than the natural talent, such as being super fast or strong, type of skills that are really requested to be the best player, but that´s not all without a great vision of the entire game.  \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nmecoge\n\nKuroko no Basket and Blue Lock are sports manga. What makes those two similar is that both has some kind of \"superpower\" system that make those two unrealistic. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nMelsonNoronha\n\nOne Outs\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nOne outs has an extremely talented player who leads the team to the victory through his tactics and talent. While blue lock program is becoming like that. They do have pretty much similarities in terms of tactics and strategies. This is one of those shows where \"Selfish players\" are not demonized to make the team players look good. The characters are well written and developed. And they're both great shows \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nCJustawaye\n\nRead recommendations by \n2\n more users\n\nWhile Isagi looks like a normal high schooler and the MC of One outs is just intimidating from ep1 , Isagi strangely starts to lose his shit the same way MC of one outs does.

They both have superpowers, the only difference being that Inazuma Eleven's are more exagerated, compared to Blue Lock's. Also, Inazuma Eleven, since it's about middle schoolers, is less serious than Blue Lock, most of the time that is. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nImEx3cut0r\n\nCaptain Tsubasa (2018)\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nPeak Football/soccer anime.\r\n\nIf you enjoyed Bluelock, then the 2018 version of the classic Captain Tsubasa is a good watch \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nCruzaid\n\nRead recommendations by \n1\n more user\n\nboth are about soccer or football\r\nblue lock is really better than cap tsubasa no disrespect and is a must-watch.\r\n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \niopcion90\n\nGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nPeople are drawn into a strange and isloated contest that encourages them to be selfish and egoistic. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nDan-Te\n\nRead recommendations by \n1\n more user\n\nboth are about survival game, in the same vein as Battle Royale and Squid Game.. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nkhrimul\n\nDays\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nBoth are about soccer, both have lots of pretty interesting characters \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nj3sper\n\nKami no Tou\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nOk, I know this one isn't a sports anime but listen - the setting is basically the same. Everyone is trapped in a big facility. There are multiple levels that challenge skills and morality - each level forces the characters to grow out of their own comfort zone. There's a goal, there's a ladder, and there's a game master. So, if you like the setting and atmosphere of Blue Lock - Tower of God might tickle your fancy. \n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \ntake0kun\n\nTomodachi Game\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nThey’re actually very similar when you look into it. Blue Lock and Tomodachi Game are both competition-based anime set in a controversial project setting ran by an eccentric leader. They develop the characters and story through the same themes – teamwork, ethics, and above all else, friendship and betrayal. Isagi and Yuuichi are both similar protagonists in the way they both develop into selfish and “evil” characters to rise to the top. The rest of the cast does too, but it’s most prominent in them. Their monologues are also similar. \r\n\nAnd when you think about, you can consider Blue Lock as a death game, only \nexcept your soccer career is at stake instead of your life, which the anime shows can be just as threatening. \n\nread more\n\nreport\n\n Recommended by \nEssenceP00L\n\nKuroko no Basket 3rd Season\n\nadd\npermalink\n\nBoth revolve around high schoolers playing a sport.

Bitter, confused, and disappointed, Isagi wonders if the outcome would have been different had he not made the pass. When the young striker returns home, an invitation from the Japan Football Union awaits him. Through an arbitrary and biased decision-making process, Isagi is one of three hundred U-18 strikers selected for a controversial project named Blue Lock. \n\nThe project's ultimate goal is to turn one of the selected players into the star striker for the Japanese national team. To find the best participant, each diamond in the rough must compete against others through a series of solo and team competitions to rise to the top. Putting aside his ethical objections to the project, Isagi feels compelled to fight his way to the top, even if it means ruthlessly crushing the dreams of 299 aspiring young strikers.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\nEdit\nBackground\nBlue Lock\n was released on Blu-ray and DVD in four volumes from January 27, 2023, to July 28, 2023.\n\nEdit\nRelated Entries\n\n Sequel\n (TV)\n\n Blue Lock vs. U-20 Japan\n\n Adaptation\n (Novel)\n\n Shousetsu Blue Lock\n\n Adaptation\n (Manga)\n\n Blue Lock\n\nRead Manga\n\n Spin-Off:\n\nBlue Lock: Episode Nagi\n (Movie)\n\n Other:\n\nBlue Lock Additional Time\n (ONA)\n\nMore related entries\n\nVisit MALxJapan\n\nMALxJapan -More than just anime-\n\nWin 3,000 USD for your story ‚úçÔ∏è\n\nSpring Sale!

Blue Lock is an anime which shows different ways of achieving our goals. Understanding Blue Lock, as simple as it is, is understanding the reasons of different characters to move forward. By no means do I think that the anime is complex or anything. So, what is going on?\n\nCharacters:\n\nEvery character is stereotypical. We got the ‚Äúgoofy‚Äù Bachira, main character Isagi, friendly straight-face Kunigami and some edgelords. We‚Äôve all seen these characters before, but all of them have something to share in common. They show us their own way of getting better, moving forward, striving for success. Kuon, for example,\n\n...\n\nwill do whatever it takes to be the last man standing, whether it is morally good or not. Barou ‚Äì a beast on the field, unstoppable rebellious force- also shares his way to victory. By realizing his mistakes, by finding someone better than him in the field where he should be the ‚Äúking‚Äù, he shows us that, whatever stops him from going forward, he will devour. Haven‚Äôt we felt the same way? Whether it is at school or at work, we have always encountered someone better than us. And that really bothers the ego of most people. What do we do then? We get better, and better till we beat that specific person ‚ÄúThose who continue to fight in spite of their despair are bestowed with the power to achieve their dream‚Äù-Ego Jinpachi.\n\n Although, we have seen a little from Kunigami, he also has something to say: ‚ÄúIf our heads drop down now, we‚Äôre done for!‚Äù(my favorite quote). Failure is merely temporary and if you accept defeat then you stay knocked down instead of getting back up. Sometimes things don‚Äôt always go our way, so press on! Try again and again and learn from failure. Some characters can get you really hyped up, getting goose bumps from what they are saying, and that is the whole point. That is why I admire most of Blue Lock characters. \n\nHere come the problems. As I said in the beginning most of them are stereotypical, so I can‚Äôt really find a favorite character from all of them. If it wasn‚Äôt for the plot twists, they would be really bland and would fall flat. On top of that, their dictionaries are pretty limited (mine too, but leave that for my profile‚Äôs comments), by repeating certain words and phrases over and over again every single episode. Annoying. \n\n8.5/10\n\nPlot:\n\nFairly simple, easy to follow, interesting plot twists and pretty enjoyable to watch. In the middle of the anime, some characters just disappeared, but I guess that we will find out what happened to them at some point. Other than that the plot is smoothly running and most episodes are fairly interesting.\n\n8/10\n\nSound:\n\nFrom the opening theme, to the ending theme every little bit of sound effect is pleasant for the ears. The commercial break sounds, the heavily distorted sounds of shooting, the sound of electricity when characters are on a spree, Barou‚Äôs awakening guitar/drums. The sound effects of this anime are clearly made to hype you up, to go outside and kick a football as hard as you can, to beat the person better than you, to finally finish your assignment, to do some actual hard work, or to go back to play some competitive games and give all your best.\n\n10/10\n\nArt:\n\nHere, is where the anime fails. Comparing the art style of the manga and the one of the anime is like comparing Berserk manga to the latest adaptations. Throughout this review I have praised the anime for hyping me up, but just by looking at the animation and art style the hype lasts a couple of seconds. The sparks and colorful mist around players is so poorly made. I understand the reason behind them, but just seeing the poor quality really ruins their whole existence. The 3D is just as horrible and noticeable as most of other 3D animations in anime. On top of that, the art is really just made to be commercially successful. 8bit really did not try to put the soul of the manga in the adaptation. After all we want hollow emotionless white eyes and impactful shots, which we do receive, but the budget version of it. \n\n6/10\n\nI have skipped some unnecessary parts, such as voice actors and illogical moments, the reason being that I find them not that impactful on the whole anime ( they don‚Äôt kill the vibe or make things better).\n\nOverall: 8\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong here. The overall score is just the overall enjoyment and fulfillment after finishing the anime. For me a good anime is an anime, which can make a person change or understand new things, such as worldviews and mindsets. Blue lock made me play football again ( not for long, I guess), made me continue with my work and not just slack off. This is a temporarily feeling, but I love that it exists.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by Qkydzaa (\n2\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nJun 20, 2023\n\nsmol_minnies\n\nMixed Feelings\n\n The beginning was very promising. The whole idea behind Project Blue Lock seemed interesting, though from a realistic point of view quite foolish and childish. \n\nHowever my main gripe with this show was the pacing. During every match and without failure, every move and thought process is over-explained and over-analysed until all the momentum of the previous action gets lost. It's all build-up without peak, which in turn just leaves you frustrated and unfulfilled. \n\nTo make things worse, they just just had to add melodrama on top of it all. Why are these teenagers dramatically breaking up with each other, or in some cases with\n\n...\n\nthe monster inside of them? Why are they all having an existential crisis in the middle of the match? Even our main guy Isagi, cosigned with the one and only Ego as an Average Joe, dismantles and rebuilds himself every episode or so. This guy just took learn and adapt to a whole new level. \n\nAlso the damn vocabulary used in this anime makes me want to bite my fingers off from the second hand embarrassment. How can these guys talk about being a hero or a king, about creating \"chemical reactions\" together, about \"devouring\" each other and not just die from cringe?? Well I guess they're teenagers after all and well that's as good of an excuse as any for such behaviour.\n\nNow, the animation was all over the place. Awkward still frames and rigid CGI on some parts, but fluid 2D and stunning visuals on others. The art definitely played a huge role in saving the day as it's quiet phenomenal. Character design is absolutely stunning and leaves nothing to complain about. \n\nLastly, Ego. This guy single-handedly carrying the title of the biggest bitch on this show. Every time he opens his damn mouth, I wonder how come he made it alive so far when he's just begging for a beating. \n\nFor a football anime, Blue Lock was more talking than ball kicking but well it had its fun moments which saved it from being an utter bore to watch.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n6\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by smol_minnies (\n11\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nFeb 29, 2024\n\nTheNinthRequiem\n\nNot Recommended\n\nFunny\n\n Picture this, you‚Äôre in extra time and it‚Äôs the final play of the game. Everyone‚Äôs sweaty and knackered, rightfully so, the scoreline is 6-6, or at least that‚Äôs what you think cause you never really keep track of the score during games. You‚Äôre in the penalty box and your best bud passes a beautiful through ball to you. You take a clean touch, fake a shot to the left, and whip the ball into the top right bin. The goalkeeper doesn‚Äôt see it coming at all. How could he? The crowd goes wild. A little quieter than normal you note‚Äìprobably cause you‚Äôre at an away\n\n...\n\ngame. The ref blows his whistle, ‚Äúfweeeeeeet‚Äù. The game‚Äôs done, you‚Äôve won. You run to the sidelines and your mom hands you your favorite drink, a scrumptious blackcurrant Ribena that was in the cooler only seconds ago. You take a comforting sip and look around. You pinpoint exactly why the crowd was quieter than usual. It‚Äôs because your dad was dozing off in the middle of the game. Your mom sees where you‚Äôre looking at and gets mad. ‚ÄúJORDAN, how many times do I have to tell you, don‚Äôt sleep during your son‚Äôs game.‚Äù You‚Äôre not mad, you understand. He had to drive your ass for an hour and a half at 6am to watch a little league football game on a Saturday morning. You take a look at the other teams bleachers, trying to find the goalkeeper you just styled on. Strange, you can‚Äôt quite pinpoint him from the coagulate of jerseys until one of them walks up to you with his mom. His mom says: ‚Äúhey, that was a great goal, my Kev could have never saved that.‚Äù You look at the child in tow, weird, you don‚Äôt remember a kid with glasses on the pitch. His mom notices and explains how she doesn‚Äôt let her son wear glasses on the pitch in case a ball hits his face. So that‚Äôs why he couldn‚Äôt save it, he couldn‚Äôt damn well see the ball could he? This, this pseudo-thrilling shithousery is Blue Lock to me. \n\nThe start of Blue Lock was actually bearable, dare I even say interesting. Seriously, it‚Äôs a good concept on paper. A bunch of ambitious teenagers vying for a chance to become Japan‚Äôs national team striker through a rigorous and ruthless training regime with one person remaining. Or that‚Äôs what it seemed at the start, until you realize that no characters introduced get eliminated. Or the absurdity of fielding a striker in goal could ever yield effective practice for anyone involved. But I understand there should be an expected level of plot armoring and suspension of disbelief afforded when it comes to these shows so I will give it some leeway. Instead, this review will focus more so on the myriad of reasons why this show doesn‚Äôt even work in an entertaining sense. \n\nFirst and foremost, it‚Äôs the animation. For some surreal reason, some people actually think the animation in this show is good. The characters are drawn decently and the food looks realistic enough. But most importantly, the actual animation of the football? Really? For the people complaining about the work of the CG in another popular series that aired the same season that I just so happen to adore‚ÄìYou should be up in arms here with knives and pitchforks screaming ‚ÄúSic ‚Äòem!‚Äù; it‚Äôs hideous. But the biggest and most heinous animation problem are the still frames filled with exposition that completely ruin the flow of each play. Matches are shown in these constant close ups of the characters slowly gliding across your screen as you hear the play happening in their head. But the play itself is never actually explicitly shown. It's reminiscent of those imovie projects you had to do for middle school where you couldn‚Äôt quite figure out how to get the images to stop moving with the ken burns effect as you try your best to match your squeaky dialogue with the 4 second image overlay. It‚Äôs an embarrassing production. Football is dynamic and exciting at heart, especially in attacking play. But this static imagery completely ruins the momentum of each play and makes it really hard to sit through some of these moments that I would like to imagine were exciting on paper. If you don‚Äôt get the animation right for a sports anime, it‚Äôs really hard to build from there. \n\nThe ranking system is atrocious and representative of everything wrong with shonen anime. Why would the ranked 299 person realistically even have a shot at becoming one of the best players. It‚Äôs this unnecessary from the bottom to the top type writing that tries to maintain hype through introducing opponents of increasingly high rank. This might work for some, but to me, it‚Äôs tedious to sit through knowing that someone with more power but with even less personality will appear and none of this matters. Take Nagi for example. How on earth does he have the ego to say he‚Äôs the best player as he‚Äôs introduced when he‚Äôs ranked 250 something in this facility alone. It‚Äôs just meaningless fluff because it‚Äôs obvious they‚Äôre trying to drum up some kind of idiotic point where he realizes oh he‚Äôs not god‚Äôs gift and there are people that challenge him here. Then Rin comes along with a similar ego complex, but is just stronger and replaces what little Nagi‚Äôs purpose was. The part that really infuriates me is that after what seems like these development arcs for each of these characters. They‚Äôre reduced to these shells of their former selves and are added to Isagi‚Äôs collection of assets like they‚Äôre all tools in Mickey Mouse‚Äôs toolbox. ‚ÄúOh toodles!!! Who will I pass to today?\" As he bring up 4 options to the screen. I can just imagine the kids watching screaming at their screen: ‚ÄúGarou! Kunigami! Bachira! Chigiri!‚Äù or whoever else ‚Äúfortunate‚Äù enough to be Isagi‚Äôs plaything at this current moment. \n\nStrikers aren't the king of the castle but Blue Lock certainly thinks so. Football is a teamsport; it‚Äôs an 11-aside game played on a 105 by 68 meter rectangular field with the objective of putting the ball in your opponents net. The game most importantly is driven by cohesive teamplay. Unlike something like basketball where there is abundant teamplay, but there are also plays that can be started and finished by a single player because the pitch is relatively small. But it‚Äôs different in football. There is so much buildup required for each goal. Blue Lock doesn‚Äôt have nearly enough of this. I think it‚Äôs because of this ignorant ‚Äúego‚Äù thing they try to drive into each player. The mortifying ‚Äúchemistry reaction‚Äù and ‚Äúdevouring‚Äù they keep bringing up as what they believe to be ‚Äúfootball‚Äù. To anyone who has not seen football, please do not look at this affront and think this is what football‚Äôs about. It‚Äôs so cringey and it hurts every fiber of my being. \n\nSimilarly, players like Bachira and Chigiri are obviously more suited to be wingers. Yet they‚Äôre still pushed into this rigid idea that they‚Äôre number 9s. It does a huge disservice to your greats like Kagawa and that legendary Japanese midfielder that people get disappointed when they pack in Fifa. These midfield Maestros are some of your greats, why would you think to disrespect them by saying strikers are the most important position. Take some time to look back at the past few world cups, was Giroud the main reason France won the world cup in 2018? How about Spain‚Äôs 4-6-0 formation where they fielded 0 strikers and won the world cup in 2010? It‚Äôs just this cringey decadent idea that strikers are the most important part that I just know comes from a place to get impressionable children riled up for your show. Frankly, it‚Äôs dishonest and insulting. \n\nAnother crucial problem with only having strikers is, you only have a limited amount of qualities and unique skills to give around where players can excel at: Pace, finishing, hold-up play, off the ball movement, spatial awareness to name the key ones. And evidently, they‚Äôre exhausted pretty quickly. What you‚Äôre then left with are pure power upgrades that I really dislike. Where it‚Äôs this childish one-upping of ‚ÄúI read his play‚Äù, ‚ÄúI read his reading of my play‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can jump higher than you‚Äù, ‚ÄúI can run faster than you‚Äù. It‚Äôs just not fun to watch from a tactical and footballing standpoint. And deep down, Blue Lock knows this, so what do they do? They decide to introduce imaginary monsters. Yes you heard me right. \n\nJust like Bachira and the monster inside of him, there are 2 wolves inside of me, one hates this show, the other also hates this show. The individual monsters of this show don‚Äôt work and don‚Äôt get expanded on. When you lean into that supernatural realm without actually doing anything meaningful with it‚ÄìOr when they don‚Äôt iron out properties of these supernatural concepts like in the case of Blue Lock, it just becomes nonsensical mumbo jumbo. You have no limit defining, everything just ends up feeling so pulled out of the hat for convenience sake. It‚Äôs also those flaming eyes when the monsters come out or when they enter ‚Äúserious mode‚Äù that are so badly animated for some of these scenes. They all start to look like Endeavor from MHA to me and it‚Äôs admittedly hysterical. But from a non-biased critiquing standpoint, it‚Äôs abhorrent. \n\nThis menagerie known as the Blue Lock facility also feels so barren and boring. There needs to be an incentive to make this program feel rewarding where players should want to stay here because they‚Äôre becoming their best selves. Be it, superior practicing methods, state of the art training equipment, illustrious coaching instructors, you name it. But Blue Lock doesn't have any of this. It just feels like a death trap that unbeknownst to each of the players before they join, if they get knocked out they can never play for the Japanese national team. I feel like these sort of stipulations should have been included in the letter. If not, screw it, just go full squid game and say if you‚Äôre knocked out you‚Äôre executed. That would have spiced things up a little bit. I also think it‚Äôs laughably pathetic how this show is only situated in an air conditioned indoor football pitch as they prepare for a competitive outdoor sport. It‚Äôs almost as if these writers couldn‚Äôt have borne the thought of not being in an airconditioned room. The world cup and every club football competition is played outdoors. So why are we conditioning these kids to never see the light of day?\n\nI don‚Äôt understand why Blue Lock had to introduce made up characters in the series. I understand this point is more a pet-peeve as not everyone that watches Blue Lock is familiar with football and that‚Äôs totally fine. But as for me, I‚Äôm just wondering why we had to make up characters mixed in with real footballing greats? Noa Noel? Seriously? Noa-ne cares. I had to sit here as they tried to explain white-washed Thierry Henry to me. You should either choose to reference only real life players or make up all the players for your world. Because from where I stand, it just sounds like you‚Äôre undermining the two goats of our football generation, Messi and Ronaldo.\n\nThe only thing that I can appreciate in this show are the subtle or not so subtle yaoi elements. It‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs keeping me engaged in this show and I‚Äôm not even lgbtq. The series really tries to reach a target demographic here and I for one am happy it succeeds on this front. When Bachira calls out to Isagi to free him from his captors. I shudder at the thought of these 2 loverboys not being together. My favorite line is when Nagi or as I know him as ‚ÄúNTR-gi‚Äù says: ‚ÄúSorry Reo, now that I know how good this feels, I can‚Äôt go back to how I was before‚Äù (20:59, Ep 20). Gosh, That was a fun episode. They should just do this every episode, feign seriousness and drop these banging sus one liners in the middle of the game. Just start testing the homies, see if you can catch one of them lacking. Alas, these characters have to be serious, they‚Äôve got indoor football matches to play! \n\nLook, if you like Blue Lock, that‚Äôs your prerogative and I could never take that away from you. Nor would I want to, everyone‚Äôs allowed to enjoy what they want. As a football fan myself, I was massively disappointed that a show I was sold to be this ‚Äúexcellent intense battle-royale football show\" fell so flat on its face. Why can all the other sports get shows like Kuroku No Basuke or Haikyuu!!, and we get this. I‚Äôve seen clips of these other shows and they look phenomenal. It‚Äôs just not fair. If you were starved of football content as an anime fan, I‚Äôd recommend watching the 2022 World Cup instead of watching this 24 episode choppy passion-devoid mess. That was a real treasure to behold.\n\n Reviewer‚Äôs Rating: \n2\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\n Nice\n\n0\n\n Love it\n\n0\n\n Funny\n\n0\n\n Confusing\n\n0\n\n Informative\n\n0\n\n Well-written\n\n0\n\n Creative\n\n0\nMore reviews by TheNinthRequiem (\n5\n)\n\nShow all\nRead more\nShow less\nOpen\n\nGift\n\nReport\n\nMore stacks\nInterest Stacks\n\nAutistic characters\n\nby\n\ngakuendo\n\n32 Entries · 75 Restacks\n\nüéßAnime with Thai dubsüáπüá≠5ÔΩúüéß‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏û‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏¢‡πå‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢üáπüá≠‡πï\n\nby\n\nAdrena\n\n50 Entries · 2 Restacks\n\nEsportes DUB PT-BR\n\nby\n\ntrephacard\n\n22 Entries · 1 Restacks\n\nMore recommendations\n\nRecommendations\n\nAo Ashi\n26 Users\nHaikyuu!!\n10 Users\nKuroko no Basket\n8 Users\nOne Outs\n3 Users\nGyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor\n2 Users\nCaptain Tsubasa (2018)\n2 Users\nInazuma Eleven\n2 Users\nTomodachi Game\n1 User\nKuroko no Basket 3rd Season\n1 User\nKami no Tou\n1 User\nDiamond no Ace\n1 User\nDays\n1 User\nDeath Note\n1 User\nDanganronpa: Kibou no Gakuen to Zetsubou no Koukousei The Animation\n1 User\nMedalist\n1 User\nBaby Steps\n1 User\nShokugeki no Souma\n1 User\nAll Out!!\n1 User\nBoku no Hero Academia\n1 User\nTokyo Revengers: Tenjiku-hen\nAutoRec\nBleach: Sennen Kessen-hen - Ketsubetsu-tan\nAutoRec\nEiyuuou, Bu wo Kiwameru Tame Tenseisu: Soshite, Sekai Saikyou no Minarai Kishi‚ôÄ\nAutoRec\nKinsou no Vermeil: Gakeppuchi Majutsushi wa Saikyou no Yakusai to Mahou Sekai wo Tsukisusumu\nAutoRec\nTomo-chan wa Onnanoko!\nAutoRec\nMore news\nRecent News\nIn Pursuit of Egoism: The Essence of 'Blue Lock'\n\n Blue Lock has quickly become a standout in the sports anime genre, known for its intense action and psychological depth as it redefines the high-stakes world of soc...\nread more\n\nOct 24, 2024 10:33 PM by \nKineta\n | \nDiscuss (6 comments)\n\nNorth American Anime & Manga Releases for May\n\nHere are the North American anime, manga, and light novel releases for May.
